<p>Applications, one at the top and three at the bottom of the illustration, are linked to an unlabeled queue in the middle. The queue contains three messages labeled <span class="bold">priority 3</span>, <span class="bold">priority 1</span>, and <span class="bold">priority 2</span> respectively. At the top of the illustration, <span class="bold">Application A, Producer</span> is linked to the queue with a downward-pointing arrow labeled <span class="bold">Enqueue</span>.</p>
<p>All three applications at the bottom carry the label <span class="bold">Consumer (Rule-Based Subscriber)</span>. At bottom left, <span class="bold">Application B</span> carries the additional label <span class="bold">&#34;priority = 1&#34;</span> and is linked to the queue with a downward-pointing arrow labeled <span class="bold">Dequeue</span>. <span class="bold">Application D</span> carries the additional label <span class="bold">&#34;priority = 3&#34;</span> and is also linked to the queue with a downward-pointing arrow. <span class="bold">Application C</span> carries the additional label <span class="bold">&#34;priority &gt; 1&#34;</span> and is linked to the queue with two arrows. One points downward and is labeled <span class="bold">Dequeue</span>. The other arrow points back to the queue and is labeled <span class="bold">Register</span>.</p>
