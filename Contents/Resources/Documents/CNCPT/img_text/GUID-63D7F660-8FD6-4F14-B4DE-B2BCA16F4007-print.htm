<p>This image shows an overview of a Database Logging Recovery Appliance installation. At the center is a single rack labeled Recovery Appliance. At the left, one above the other, are 6 hosts, all labeled &#34;Protected Database.&#34; The top three each look like a tower workstation with attached storage. The bottom three are racks.

It is connected to the central Database Backup Logging Recovery Appliance rack by an unlabeled two-way arrow. At the right center is an image of a tape library, and an arrow going from the central Database Backup Logging Recovery Appliance rack to the tape library is labeled &#34;Tape Backup.&#34; At the bottom right is a double rack labeled Remote Recovery Appliance.
