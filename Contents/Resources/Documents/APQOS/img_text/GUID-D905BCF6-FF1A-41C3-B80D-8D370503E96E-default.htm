<p>The screenshot shows the top portion of the Performance Class Quality of Service page. There is a single chart in this screenshot, the Performance Satisfaction Metric (PSM) chart. The y-axis measures PSM(%) with values from -80 to +80. The x-axis measures Time in intervals of five minutes.</p>
<p>The chart legend indicates that seven performance classes are being monitored: Default_pc, sales_pc, erp_pc, hr_pc, salescart_pc, shipping_pc, and etl_pc. Each performance class is represented in the chart by a different colored line. The Default_pc performance class has a line that is higher than any other performance class and the salescart_pc performance class has a line that is lower than any other performance class. The Default_pc line is constantly at 100. Because the salescart_pc is not currently meeting its performance objective, the salescart_pc line is around -60. The lines rise and fall at irregular intervals, but there are no large spikes seen in the graph.</p>
