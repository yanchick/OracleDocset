<p>The Demand chart measure the number of Requests each Second against Time. The chart legend indicates that seven performance classes are being monitored: Default_pc, sales_pc, erp_pc, hr_pc, salescart_pc, shipping_pc, and etl_pc. Each performance class is represented in the chart by a different colored line. The line for the salescart_pc performance class is at the top of the chart, averaging around 185 requests each second. The line for the Default_pc performance class is at the bottom of the chart, averaging between 0 and 10 requests each second. The erp_pc and hr_pc performance classes average around 85 requests per second, but have periodic large decreases in demand. The line for etl_pc is almost flat at 50 requests per second. The other performance classes, shipping_pc and sales_pc, have almost flat lines measuring close to 100 requests each second.</p>
