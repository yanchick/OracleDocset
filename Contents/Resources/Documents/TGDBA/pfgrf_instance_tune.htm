<p>The remainder of this chapter discusses instance tuning using the Oracle Database dynamic performance views. However, Oracle recommends using Automatic Workload Repository (AWR) and Automatic Database Diagnostic Monitor (ADDM) for statistics gathering, monitoring, and tuning due to the extended feature list.</p>

<div class="section">
<p>It is vital to develop a good understanding of the purpose of the tuning exercise and the nature of the problem before attempting to implement a solution. Without this understanding, it is virtually impossible to implement effective changes. The data gathered during this stage helps determine the next step to take and what evidence to examine.</p>
<p>Gather the following data:</p>
</div>
<!-- class="section" -->
<ol>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Identify the performance objective.</span>
<div>
<p>What is the measure of acceptable performance? How many transactions an hour, or seconds, response time will meet the required performance level?</p>
</div>
</li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Identify the scope of the problem.</span>
<div>
<p>What is affected by the slowdown? For example, is the whole instance slow? Is it a particular application, program, specific operation, or a single user?</p>
</div>
</li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Identify the time frame when the problem occurs.</span>
<div>
<p>Is the problem only evident during peak hours? Does performance deteriorate over the course of the day? Was the slowdown gradual (over the space of months or weeks) or sudden?</p>
</div>
</li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Quantify the slowdown.</span>
<div>
<p>This helps identify the extent of the problem and also acts as a measure for comparison when deciding whether changes implemented to fix the problem have actually made an improvement. Find a consistently reproducible measure of the response time or job run time. How much worse are the timings than when the program was running well?</p>
</div>
</li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Identify any changes.</span>
<div>
<p>Identify what has changed since performance was acceptable. This may narrow the potential cause quickly. For example, has the operating system software, hardware, application software, or Oracle Database release been upgraded? Has more data been loaded into the system, or has the data volume or user population grown?</p>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="section">
<p>At the end of this phase, you should have a good understanding of the symptoms. If the symptoms can be identified as local to a program or set of programs, then the problem is handled in a different manner from instance-wide performance issues.</p>

<h3 id="TGDBA-GUID-26F451C1-3A30-4E9D-AD41-F1C02446E5A7" class="sect3">Examine the Host System</h3>
<div>
<p>Look at the load on the database server and the database instance. Consider the operating system, the I/O subsystem, and network statistics, because examining these areas helps determine what might be worth further investigation. In multitier systems, also examine the application server middle-tier hosts.</p>
<p>Examining the host hardware often gives a strong indication of the bottleneck in the system. This determines which Oracle Database performance data could be useful for cross-reference and further diagnosis.</p>
<p>Data to examine includes the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">

<h4 id="TGDBA-GUID-AF97FAB4-36DB-464B-AB7F-1087F367E22D" class="sect4">CPU Usage</h4>
<div>
<p>If there is a significant amount of idle CPU, then there could be an I/O, application, or database bottleneck. Note that wait I/O should be considered as idle CPU.</p>
<p>If there is high CPU usage, then determine whether the CPU is being used effectively. Is the majority of CPU usage attributable to a small number of high-CPU using programs, or is the CPU consumed by an evenly distributed workload?</p>
<p>If a small number of high-usage programs use the CPU, then look at the programs to determine the cause. Check whether some processes alone consume the full power of one CPU. Depending on the process, this could indicate a CPU or process-bound workload that can be tackled by dividing or parallelizing process activity.</p>
</div>
<a id="TGDBA94439"></a>
<div class="props_rev_3"><a id="GUID-59B45479-273A-4451-B948-037694AD75A4"></a>
<h5 id="TGDBA-GUID-59B45479-273A-4451-B948-037694AD75A4" class="sect5">Non-Oracle Processes</h5>
<div>
<p>If the programs are not Oracle programs, then identify whether they are legitimately requiring that amount of CPU. If so, determine whether their execution be delayed to off-peak hours. Identifying these CPU intensive processes can also help narrowing what specific activity, such as I/O, network, and paging, is consuming resources and how can it be related to the database workload.</p>
</div>
</div>
<a id="TGDBA94440"></a>
<div class="props_rev_3"><a id="GUID-E646D37F-AD4C-4819-89E6-6915AACC8099"></a>
<h5 id="TGDBA-GUID-E646D37F-AD4C-4819-89E6-6915AACC8099" class="sect5">Oracle Processes</h5>
<div>
<p>If a small number of Oracle processes consumes most of the CPU resources, then use <code>SQL_TRACE</code> and <code>TKPROF</code> to identify the SQL or PL/SQL statements to see if a particular query or PL/SQL program unit can be tuned. For example, a SELECT statement could be CPU-intensive if its execution involves many reads of data in cache (logical reads) that could be avoided with better SQL optimization.</p>

<div>
<p>Oracle Database CPU statistics are available in several <code>V$</code> views:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p><code>V$SYSSTAT</code> shows Oracle Database CPU usage for all sessions. The <code>CPU</code> <code>used</code> <code>by</code> <code>this</code> <code>session</code> statistic shows the aggregate CPU used by all sessions. The <code>parse</code> <code>time</code> <code>cpu</code> statistic shows the total CPU time used for parsing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>V$SESSTAT</code> shows Oracle Database CPU usage for each session. Use this view to determine which particular session is using the most CPU.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>V$RSRC_CONSUMER_GROUP</code> shows CPU utilization statistics for each consumer group when the Oracle Database Resource <a id="d20882e492" class="indexterm-anchor"></a>Manager is running.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<a id="TGDBA94442"></a>
<div class="props_rev_3"><a id="GUID-9CE157DC-EDE2-49F4-961F-3296334FC771"></a>
<h5 id="TGDBA-GUID-9CE157DC-EDE2-49F4-961F-3296334FC771" class="sect5">Interpreting CPU Statistics</h5>
<div>
<p>It is important to recognize that CPU time and real time are distinct. With eight CPUs, for any given minute in real time, there are eight minutes of CPU time available. On Windows and UNIX, this can be either user time or system time (privileged mode on Windows). Thus, average CPU time utilized by all processes (threads) on the system could be greater than one minute for every one minute real time interval.</p>
<p>At any given moment, you know how much time Oracle Database has used on the system. So, if eight minutes are available and Oracle Database uses four minutes of that time, then you know that 50% of all CPU time is used by Oracle. If your process is not consuming that time, then some other process is. Identify the processes that are using CPU time, figure out why, and then attempt to tune them.</p>
<p>If the CPU usage is evenly distributed over many Oracle server processes, examine the <code>V$SYS_TIME_MODEL</code> view to help get a precise understanding of where most time is spent. See <a href="pfgrf_instance_tune.htm#GUID-BB5A0533-F6F2-413C-A56D-A8BDB870536B__g44034" title="This table links wait events to potential causes and gives an overview of the Oracle data that could be most useful to review next.">Table 10-1</a>.</p>

If the I/O system is overly active, then check for potential hot spots that could benefit from distributing the I/O across more disks. Also identify whether the load can be reduced by lowering the resource requirements of the programs using those resources. If the I/O problems are caused by Oracle Database, then I/O tuning can begin. If Oracle Database is not consuming the available I/O resources, then identify the process that is using up the I/O. Determine why the process is using up the I/O, and then tune this process.</p>
<p>I/O problems can be identified using <code>V$</code> views in Oracle Database and monitoring tools in the operating system, as described in the following sections:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">

<div>
<div class="section">
<p>Check the Oracle wait event data in <code>V$SYSTEM_EVENT</code> to see whether the top wait events are I/O related. I/O related events include <code>db</code> <code>file</code> <code>sequential</code> <code>read</code>, <code>db</code> <code>file</code> <code>scattered</code> <code>read</code>, <code>db</code> <code>file</code> <code>single</code> <code>write</code>, <code>db</code> <code>file</code> <code>parallel</code> <code>write</code>, and <code>log</code> <code>file</code> <code>parallel</code> <code>write</code>. These are all events corresponding to I/Os performed against data files and log files. If any of these wait events correspond to high average time, then investigate the <a id="d20882e710" class="indexterm-anchor"></a>I/O contention.</p>
<p>Cross reference the host I/O system data with the I/O sections in the Automatic Repository report to identify hot data files and tablespaces. Also compare the I/O times reported by the operating system with the times reported by Oracle Database to see if they are consistent.</p>
<p>An I/O problem can also manifest itself with non-I/O related wait events. For example, the difficulty in finding a free buffer in the buffer cache or high wait times for logs to be flushed to disk can also be symptoms of an I/O problem. Before investigating whether the I/O system should be reconfigured, determine if the load on the I/O system can be reduced.</p>
<p>To reduce I/O load caused by Oracle Database, examine the I/O statistics collected for all I/O calls made by the database using the following views:</p>
</div>
<!-- class="section" -->
<div class="section">
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p><code>V$IOSTAT_CONSUMER_GROUP</code></p>
<p>The <code>V$IOSTAT_CONSUMER_GROUP</code> view captures I/O statistics for consumer groups. If Oracle Database Resource Manager is enabled, I/O statistics for all consumer groups that are part of the currently enabled resource plan are captured.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>V$IOSTAT_FILE</code></p>
<p>The <code>V$IOSTAT_FILE</code> view captures I/O statistics of database files that are or have been accessed. The <code>SMALL_SYNC_READ_LATENCY</code> column displays the latency for single block synchronous reads (in milliseconds), which translates directly to the amount of time that clients need to wait before moving onto the next operation. This defines the responsiveness of the storage subsystem based on the current load. If there is a high latency for critical data files, you may want to consider relocating these files to improve their service time. To calculate latency statistics, <code>timed_statistics</code> must be set to <code>TRUE</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>V$IOSTAT_FUNCTION</code></p>
<p>The <code>V$IOSTAT_FUNCTION</code> view captures I/O statistics for database functions (such as the LGWR and DBWR).</p>
<p>An I/O can be issued by various Oracle processes with different functionalities. The top database functions are classified in the <code>V$IOSTAT_FUNCTION</code> view. In cases when there is a conflict of I/O functions, the I/O is placed in the bucket with the lower <code>FUNCTION_ID</code>. For example, if XDB issues an I/O from the buffer cache, the I/O would be classified as an XDB I/O because it has a lower <code>FUNCTION_ID</code> value. Any unclassified function is placed in the Others bucket. You can display the <code>FUNCTION_ID</code> hierarchy by querying the <code>V$IOSTAT_FUNCTION</code> view:</p>
<pre dir="ltr">select FUNCTION_ID, FUNCTION_NAME
from v$iostat_function
order by FUNCTION_ID;

FUNCTION_ID FUNCTION_NAME
----------- ------------------
           0 RMAN
           1 DBWR
           2 LGWR
           3 ARCH
           4 XDB
           5 Streams AQ
           6 Data Pump
           7 Recovery
           8 Buffer Cache Reads
           9 Direct Reads
          10 Direct Writes
          11 Others
</pre></li>
</ul>
<p>These <code>V$IOSTAT</code> views contains I/O statistics for both single and multi block read and write operations. Single block operations are small I/Os that are less than or equal to 128 kilobytes. Multi block operations are large I/Os that are greater than 128 kilobytes. For each of these operations, the following statistics are collected:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p>Identifier</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Total wait time (in milliseconds)</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Use operating system monitoring tools to determine what processes are running on the system as a whole and to monitor disk access to all files.

<h4 id="TGDBA-GUID-83A6CEC9-B4B5-4335-ACAF-D39C8649664B" class="sect4">Wait Events</h4>
<div>
<p>Wait events are statistics that are incremented by a server process or thread to indicate that it had to wait for an event to complete before being able to continue processing. Wait event data reveals various symptoms of problems that might be impacting performance, such as latch contention, buffer contention, and <a id="d20882e1134" class="indexterm-anchor"></a>I/O contention. Remember that these are only symptoms of problems, not the actual causes.</p>
<p>Wait events are grouped into classes. The wait event <a id="d20882e1141" class="indexterm-anchor"></a><a id="d20882e1145" class="indexterm-anchor"></a>classes include: Administrative, Application, Cluster, Commit, Concurrency, Configuration, Idle, Network, Other, Scheduler, System I/O, and User I/O.</p>
<p>A server process can wait for the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p>A resource to become available, such as a buffer or a latch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An action to complete, such as an I/O.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More work to do, such as waiting for the client to provide the next SQL statement to execute. Events that identify that a server process is waiting for more work are known as idle events.</p>
<div class="infoboxnotealso" id="GUID-83A6CEC9-B4B5-4335-ACAF-D39C8649664B__GUID-BF0DCF9B-1F6A-4080-9581-CCDDEA04931D">

</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Wait event statistics include the number of times an event was waited for and the time waited for the event to complete. If the initialization parameter <code>TIMED_STATISTICS</code> is set to <code>true</code>, then you can also see how long each resource was waited for.</p>
<p>To minimize user response time, reduce the time spent by server processes waiting for event completion. Not all wait events have the same wait time. Therefore, it is more important to examine events with the most total time waited rather than wait events with a high number of occurrences. Usually, it is best to set the dynamic parameter <code>TIMED_STATISTICS</code> to <code>true</code> at least while monitoring performance.

<p>Investigate wait events and related timing data when performing reactive performance tuning. The events with the most time listed against them are often strong indications of the performance bottleneck. For example, by looking at <code>V$SYSTEM_EVENT</code>, you might notice lots of <code>buffer</code> <code>busy</code> <code>waits</code>. It might be that many processes are inserting into the same block and must wait for each other before they can insert. The solution could be to use automatic segment space management or partitioning for the object in question.

<p>System statistics are typically used in conjunction with wait event data to find further evidence of the cause of a performance problem.</p>
<p>For example, if <code>V$SYSTEM_EVENT</code> indicates that the largest wait event (in terms of wait time) is the event <code>buffer</code> <code>busy</code> <code>waits</code>, then look at the specific buffer wait statistics available in the view <a id="d20882e1471" class="indexterm-anchor"></a><code>V$WAITSTAT</code> to see which block type has the highest wait count and the highest wait time.</p>

<div>
<p>You can gather segment-level statistics to help you spot performance problems associated with individual segments. Collecting and viewing segment-level statistics is a good way to effectively identify hot tables or indexes in an instance.</p>
<p>After viewing wait events and system statistics to identify the performance problem, you can use segment-level statistics to find specific tables or indexes that are causing the problem. Consider, for example, that <code>V$SYSTEM_EVENT</code> indicates that buffer busy waits cause a fair amount of wait time. You can select from <code>V$SEGMENT_STATISTICS</code> the top segments that cause the buffer busy waits. Then you can focus your effort on eliminating the problem in those segments.</p>
<p>You can query segment-level statistics through the following dynamic performance views:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p><code>V$SEGSTAT_NAME:</code> This view lists the segment statistics being collected and the properties of each statistic (for instance, if it is a sampled statistic).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>V$SEGSTAT:</code> This is a highly efficient, real-time monitoring view that shows the statistic value, statistic name, and other basic information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>V$SEGMENT_STATISTICS:</code> This is a user-friendly view of statistic values. In addition to all the columns of <code>V$SEGSTAT</code>, it has information about such things as the segment owner and table space name. It makes the statistics easy to understand, but it is more costly.</p>

<h3 id="TGDBA-GUID-AA7607E6-8A86-4A54-88B7-161CA970D052" class="sect3">Implement and Measure Change</h3>
<div>
<p>Often at the end of a tuning exercise, it is possible to identify two or three changes that could potentially alleviate the problem. To identify which change provides the most benefit, it is recommended that only one change be implemented at a time. The effect of the change should be measured against the baseline data measurements found in the problem definition phase.</p>
<p>Typically, most sites with dire performance problems implement several overlapping changes at once, and thus cannot identify which changes provided any benefit. Although this is not immediately an issue, this becomes a significant hindrance if similar problems subsequently appear, because it is not possible to know which of the changes provided the most benefit and which efforts to prioritize.</p>
<p>If it is not possible to implement changes separately, then try to measure the effects of dissimilar changes. For example, measure the effect of making an initialization change to optimize redo generation separately from the effect of creating a new index to improve the performance of a modified query. It is impossible to measure the benefit of performing an operating system upgrade if SQL is tuned, the operating system disk layout is changed, and the initialization parameters are also changed at the same time.</p>
<p>Performance tuning is an iterative process. It is unlikely to find a &#39;silver bullet&#39; that solves an instance-wide performance problem. In most cases, excellent performance requires iteration through the performance tuning phases, because solving one bottleneck often uncovers another (sometimes worse) problem.</p>
<p>Knowing when to stop tuning is also important. The best measure of performance is user perception, rather than how close the statistic is to an ideal value.</p>

<p>Load-related statistics to examine include <code>redo</code> <code>size</code>, <code>session</code> <code>logical</code> <code>reads</code>, <code>db</code> <code>block</code> <code>changes</code>, <code>physical</code> <code>reads</code>, <code>physical read total bytes, physical</code> <code>writes</code>, <code>physical write total bytes, parse</code> <code>count</code> (<code>total</code>), <code>parse</code> <code>count</code> (<code>hard</code>), and <code>user</code> <code>calls</code>. This data is queried from <code>V$SYSSTAT</code>. It is best to normalize this data over seconds and over transactions. It is also useful to examine the total I/O load in MB per second by using the sum of physical read total bytes and physical write total bytes. The combined value includes the I/O&#39;s used to buffer cache, redo logs, archive logs, by Recovery Manager (RMAN) backup and recovery and any Oracle Database background process.</p>
<p>In the AWR report, look at the Load Profile section. The data has been normalized over transactions and over seconds.</p>
<div class="section">
<p class="subhead3">Changing Load</p>
<p>The load profile statistics over seconds show the changes in throughput (that is, whether the instance is performing more work each second). The statistics over transactions identify changes in the application characteristics by comparing these to the corresponding statistics from the baseline report.</p>
</div>
<!-- class="section" -->
<div class="section">
<p class="subhead3">High Rates of Activity</p>
<p>Examine the statistics normalized over seconds to identify whether the rates of activity are very high. It is difficult to make blanket recommendations on high values, because the thresholds are different on each site and are contingent on the application characteristics, the number and speed of CPUs, the operating system, the I/O system, and the Oracle Database release.</p>
<p>The following are some generalized examples (acceptable values vary at each site):</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p>A hard parse rate of more than 100 a second indicates that there is a very high amount of hard parsing on the system. High hard parse rates cause serious performance issues and must be investigated. Usually, a high hard parse rate is accompanied by <a id="d20882e1828" class="indexterm-anchor"></a><a id="d20882e1832" class="indexterm-anchor"></a>latch contention on the shared pool and library cache latches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check whether the sum of the wait times for library cache and shared pool latch events (latch: library cache, latch: library cache pin, latch: library cache lock and latch: shared pool) is significant compared to statistic <code>DB</code> <code>time</code> found in <code>V$SYSSTAT</code>. If so, examine the <code>SQL</code> <code>ordered</code> <code>by</code> <code>Parse</code> <code>Calls</code> section of the AWR report.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A high soft parse rate could be in the rate of 300 a second or more. Unnecessary soft parses also limit application scalability. Optimally, a SQL statement should be soft parsed once in each session and executed many times.</p>
</li>

<div>
<div class="section">
<p>Whenever an Oracle process waits for something, it records the wait using one of a set of predefined wait events. These wait events are grouped in wait classes. The Idle wait class groups all events that a process waits for when it does not have work to do and is waiting for more work to perform. Non-idle events indicate nonproductive time spent waiting for a resource or action to complete.</p>
<div class="infobox-note" id="GUID-03F070F3-81DF-4649-820C-DAD28AEF0871__GUID-0A48D124-CAEA-407E-96CD-1AC9587492BD">

</div>
<p>The most effective way to use wait event data is to order the events by the wait time. This is only possible if <code>TIMED_STATISTICS</code> is set to <code>true</code>. Otherwise, the wait events can only be ranked by the number of times waited, which is often not the ordering that best represents the problem.</p>

<p>Alternatively, look at the Top 5 Timed Events section at the beginning of the Automatic Workload Repository report. This section automatically orders the wait events (omitting idle events), and calculates the relative percentage:</p>

<p>In some situations, there might be a few events with similar percentages. This can provide extra evidence if all the events are related to the same type of resource request (for example, all I/O related events).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look at the number of waits for these events, and the average wait time. For example, for I/O related events, the average time might help identify whether the I/O system is slow. The following example of this data is taken from the Wait Event section of the AWR report:</p>
<pre dir="ltr">                                                             Avg

<li>
<p>The top wait events identify the next places to investigate. A table of common wait events is listed in <a href="pfgrf_instance_tune.htm#GUID-BB5A0533-F6F2-413C-A56D-A8BDB870536B__g44034" title="This table links wait events to potential causes and gives an overview of the Oracle data that could be most useful to review next.">Table 10-1</a>. It is usually a good idea to also have quick look at high-load SQL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Examine the related data indicated by the wait events to see what other information this data provides. Determine whether this information is consistent with the wait event data. In most situations, there is enough data to begin developing a theory about the potential causes of the performance bottleneck.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To determine whether this theory is valid, cross-check data you have examined with other statistics available for consistency. The appropriate statistics vary depending on the problem, but usually include load profile-related data in <code>V$SYSSTAT</code>, operating system statistics, and so on. Perform cross-checks with other data to confirm or refute the developing theory.</p>

<div>
<p>There are several statistics that can indicate performance problems that do not have corresponding wait events.</p>
<div class="section">
<p class="subhead3">Redo Log Space Requests Statistic</p>
<p>The <code>V$SYSSTAT</code> statistic <code>redo</code> <code>log</code> <code>space</code> <code>requests</code> indicates how many times a server process had to wait for space in the online redo log, not for space in the redo log buffer. Use this statistic and the wait events as an indication that you must tune checkpoints, DBWR, or archiver activity, not LGWR. Increasing the size of the log buffer does not help.</p>
</div>
<!-- class="section" -->
<div class="section">
<p class="subhead3">Read Consistency</p>
<p><a id="d20882e2440" class="indexterm-anchor"></a><a id="d20882e2442" class="indexterm-anchor"></a>Your system might spend excessive time rolling back changes to blocks in order to maintain a consistent view. Consider the following scenarios:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p>If there are many small transactions and an active long-running query is running in the background on the same table where the changes are happening, then the query might need to roll back those changes often, in order to obtain a read-consistent image of the table. Compare the following <code>V$SYSSTAT</code> statistics to determine whether this is happening:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p><code>consistent</code>: <code>changes</code> statistic indicates the number of times a database block has rollback entries applied to perform a consistent read on the block. Workloads that produce a great deal of <code>consistent</code> <code>changes</code> can consume a great deal of resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>consistent gets</code>: statistic counts the number of logical reads in consistent mode.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there are few very, large rollback segments, then your system could be spending a lot of time rolling back the transaction table during delayed block cleanout in order to find out exactly which system change number (SCN) a transaction was committed. When Oracle Database commits a transaction, all modified blocks are not necessarily updated with the commit SCN immediately. In this case, it is done later on demand when the block is read or updated. This is called delayed<a id="d20882e2477" class="indexterm-anchor"></a> block cleanout.</p>
<p>The ratio of the following <code>V$SYSSTAT</code> statistics should be close to one:</p>
<pre dir="ltr">ratio = transaction tables consistent reads - undo records applied /
        transaction tables consistent read rollbacks
</pre>
<p>The recommended solution is to use automatic undo management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there are insufficient rollback segments, then there is rollback segment (header or block) contention. Evidence of this problem is available by the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p>Comparing the number of <code>WAITS</code> to the number of <code>GETS</code> in <code>V$ROLLSTAT</code>; the proportion of <code>WAITS</code> to <code>GETS</code> should be small.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Examining <code>V$WAITSTAT</code> to see whether there are many <code>WAITS</code> for buffers of <code>CLASS</code> &#39;<code>undo</code> <code>header</code>&#39;.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The recommended solution is to use automatic undo management.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<!-- class="section" -->
<div class="section">
<p class="subhead3">Table Fetch by Continued Row</p>
<p>You can detect migrated or chained rows by checking the number of <code>table</code> <code>fetch</code> <code>continued</code> <code>row</code> statistic in <code>V$SYSSTAT</code>. A small number of chained rows (less than 1%) is unlikely to impact system performance. However, a large percentage of chained rows can affect performance.</p>
<p>Chaining on rows larger than the block size is inevitable. Consider using a tablespace with a larger block size for such data.</p>
<p>However, for smaller rows, you can avoid chaining by using sensible space parameters and good application design. For example, do <span class="italic">not</span> insert a row with key values filled in and nulls in most other columns, then update that row with the real data, causing the row to grow in size. Rather, insert rows filled with data from the start.</p>
<p><a id="d20882e2559" class="indexterm-anchor"></a><a id="d20882e2561" class="indexterm-anchor"></a>If an <code>UPDATE</code> statement increases the amount of data in a row so that the row no longer fits in its data block, then Oracle Database tries to find another block with enough free space to hold the entire row. If such a block is available, then Oracle Database moves the entire row to the new block. This operation is called <span class="bold">row migration</span>. If the row is too large to fit into any available block, then the database splits the row into multiple pieces and stores each piece in a separate block. This operation is called <span class="bold">row chaining</span>. The database can also chain rows when they are inserted.</p>
<p>Migration and chaining are especially detrimental to performance with the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p><code>UPDATE</code> statements that cause migration and chaining to perform poorly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Queries that select migrated or chained rows because these must perform additional input and output</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The definition of a sample output table named <code>CHAINED_ROWS</code> appears in a SQL script available on your distribution medium. The common name of this script is <code>UTLCHN1</code>.<code>SQL</code>, although its exact name and location varies depending on your platform. Your output table must have the same column names, data types, and sizes as the <code>CHAINED_ROWS</code> table.</p>
<p>Increasing <code>PCTFREE</code> can help to avoid migrated rows. If you leave more free space available in the block, then the row has room to grow. You can also reorganize or re-create tables and indexes that have high deletion rates. If tables frequently have rows deleted, then data blocks can have partially free space in them. If rows are inserted and later expanded, then the inserted rows might land in blocks with deleted rows but still not have enough room to expand. Reorganizing the table ensures that the main free space is totally empty blocks.</p>

<p class="subhead3">Parse-Related Statistics</p>
<p>The more your application parses, the more potential for contention exists, and the more time your system spends waiting. If <code>parse</code> <code>time</code> <code>CPU</code> represents a large percentage of the CPU time, then time is being spent parsing instead of executing statements. If this is the case, then it is likely that the application is using literal SQL and so SQL cannot be shared, or the shared pool is poorly configured.</p>
<p>There are several statistics available to identify the extent of time spent parsing by Oracle. Query the parse related statistics from <code>V$SYSSTAT</code>. For example:</p>
<pre dir="ltr">SELECT NAME, VALUE
  FROM V$SYSSTAT
 WHERE NAME IN (  &#39;parse time cpu&#39;, &#39;parse time elapsed&#39;,
                  &#39;parse count (hard)&#39;, &#39;CPU used by this session&#39; );
</pre>
<p>There are various ratios that can be computed to assist in determining whether parsing may be a problem:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p>parse time CPU / parse time elapsed</p>
<p>This ratio indicates how much of the time spent parsing was due to the parse operation itself, rather than waiting for resources, such as latches. A ratio of one is good, indicating that the elapsed time was not spent waiting for highly contended resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>parse time CPU / CPU used by this session</p>
<p>This ratio indicates how much of the total CPU used by Oracle server processes was spent on parse-related operations. A ratio closer to zero is good, indicating that the majority of CPU is not spent on parsing.</p>

<p>Investigate wait events and related timing data when performing reactive performance tuning. The events with the most time listed against them are often strong indications of the performance bottleneck.</p>
<p>The following views contain related, but different, views of the same data:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p><code>V$SESSION</code> lists session information for each current session. It lists either the event currently being waited for, or the event last waited for on each session. This view also contains information about blocking sessions, the wait state, and the wait time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>V$SESSION_WAIT</code> is a current state view. It lists either the event currently being waited for, or the event last waited for on each session, the wait state, and the wait time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>V$SESSION_WAIT_HISTORY</code> lists the last 10 wait events for each current session and the associated wait time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>V$SESSION_EVENT</code> lists the cumulative history of events waited for on each session. After a session exits, the wait event statistics for that session are removed from this view.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>V$SYSTEM_EVENT</code> lists the events and times waited for by the whole instance (that is, all session wait events data rolled up) since instance startup.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Because <code>V$SESSION_WAIT</code> is a current state view, it also contains a finer-granularity of information than <code>V$SESSION_EVENT</code> or <code>V$SYSTEM_EVENT</code>. It includes additional identifying data for the current event in three parameter columns: <code>P1</code>, <code>P2</code>, and <code>P3</code>.</p>
<p>For example, <code>V$SESSION_EVENT</code> can show that session 124 (SID=124) had many waits on the <code>db</code> <code>file</code> <code>scattered</code> <code>read</code>, but it does not show which file and block number. However, <code>V$SESSION_WAIT</code> shows the file number in <code>P1</code>, the block number read in <code>P2</code>, and the number of blocks read in <code>P3</code> (<code>P1</code> and <code>P2</code> let you determine for which segments the wait event is occurring).</p>
<p>This section concentrates on examples using <code>V$SESSION_WAIT</code>. However, Oracle recommends capturing performance data over an interval and keeping this data for performance and capacity analysis. This form of rollup data is queried from the <code>V$SYSTEM_EVENT</code> view by AWR.</p>
<p>Most commonly encountered events are described in this chapter, listed in case-sensitive alphabetical order. Other event-related data to examine is also included. The case used for each event name is that which appears in the <code>V$SYSTEM_EVENT</code> view.</p>

<h3 id="TGDBA-GUID-B1B8C07C-7255-40DD-B75D-386BCA50B4D5" class="sect3">Changes to Wait Event Statistics from Past Releases</h3>
<div>
<p>Starting with Oracle Database 11<span class="italic">g</span>, Oracle Database accumulates wait counts and time outs for wait events (such as in the <code>V$SYSTEM_EVENT</code> view) differently than in past releases. Continuous waits for certain types of resources (such as enqueues) are internally divided into a set of shorter wait calls. In releases prior to Oracle Database 11<span class="italic">g</span>, each individual internal wait call was counted as a separate wait. Starting with Oracle Database 11<span class="italic">g</span>, a single resource wait is recorded as a single wait, irrespective of the number of internal time outs experienced by the session during the wait.</p>
<p>This change allows Oracle Database to display a more representative wait count, and an accurate total time spent waiting for the resource. Time outs now refer to the resource wait, instead of the individual internal wait calls. This change also affects the average wait time and the maximum wait time. For example, if a user session must wait for an enqueue in order for a transaction row lock to update a single row in a table, and it takes 10 seconds to acquire the enqueue, Oracle Database breaks down the enqueue wait into 3-second wait calls. In this example, there will be three 3-second wait calls, followed by a 1-second wait call. From the session&#39;s perspective, however, there is only one wait on an enqueue.</p>
<p>In releases prior to Oracle Database 11<span class="italic">g</span>, the <code>V$SYSTEM_EVENT</code> view would represent this wait scenario as follows:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p><code>TOTAL_WAITS</code>: 4 waits (three 3-second waits, one 1-second wait)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>TOTAL_TIMEOUTS</code>: 3 time outs (the first three waits time out and the enqueue is acquired during the final wait)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>TIME_WAITED</code>: 10 seconds (sum of the times from the 4 waits)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>AVERAGE_WAIT</code>: 2.5 seconds</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>MAX_WAIT</code>: 3 seconds</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Starting with Oracle Database 11<span class="italic">g</span>, this wait scenario is represented as:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p><code>TOTAL_WAITS</code>: 1 wait (one 10-second wait)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>TOTAL_TIMEOUTS</code>: 0 time outs (the enqueue is acquired during the resource wait)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TIME_WAITED: 10 seconds (time for the resource wait)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>AVERAGE_WAIT</code>: 10 seconds</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>MAX_WAIT</code>: 10 seconds</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The following common wait events are affected by this change:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>

<p class="subhead3">Actions</p>
<p>The action required depends on the class of block contended for and the actual segment.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Segment Header</span></p>
<p>If the contention is on the segment header, then this is most likely free list contention.</p>
<p><a id="d20882e3205" class="indexterm-anchor"></a>Automatic segment-space management in locally managed tablespaces eliminates the need to specify the <code>PCTUSED</code>, <code>FREELISTS</code>, and <code>FREELIST</code> <code>GROUPS</code> parameters. If possible, switch from manual space management to automatic segment-space management (ASSM).</p>
<p>The following information is relevant if you are unable to use ASSM (for example, because the tablespace uses dictionary space management).</p>
<p>A <a id="d20882e3224" class="indexterm-anchor"></a>free list is a list of free data blocks that usually includes blocks existing in several different extents within the segment. Free lists are composed of blocks in which free space has not yet reached PCTFREE or used space has shrunk below PCTUSED. Specify the number of process free lists with the <code>FREELISTS</code> parameter. The default value of <code>FREELISTS</code> is one. The maximum value depends on the data block size.</p>
<p>To find the current setting for free lists for that segment, run the following:</p>
<pre dir="ltr">SELECT SEGMENT_NAME, FREELISTS

<div>
<p>This event signifies that the user process is reading buffers into the SGA buffer cache and is waiting for a physical I/O call to return. A <code>db file scattered read</code> issues a scattered read to read the data into multiple discontinuous memory locations. A scattered read is usually a multiblock read. It can occur for a fast full scan (of an index) in addition to a full table scan.</p>
<p><a id="d20882e3353" class="indexterm-anchor"></a><a id="d20882e3355" class="indexterm-anchor"></a><a id="d20882e3357" class="indexterm-anchor"></a>The <code>db</code> <code>file</code> <code>scattered</code> <code>read</code> wait event identifies that a full scan is occurring. When performing a full scan into the <a id="d20882e3375" class="indexterm-anchor"></a>buffer cache, the blocks read are read into memory locations that are not physically adjacent to each other. Such reads are called scattered read calls, because the blocks are scattered throughout memory. This is why the corresponding wait event is called &#39;db file scattered read&#39;. multiblock (up to <code>DB_FILE_MULTIBLOCK_READ_COUNT</code> blocks) reads due to full scans into the buffer cache show up as waits for &#39;db file scattered read&#39;.</p>

<p><a id="d20882e3442" class="indexterm-anchor"></a><a id="d20882e3446" class="indexterm-anchor"></a>There are several ways to handle excessive I/O waits. In the order of effectiveness, these are as follows:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p>Reduce the I/O activity by SQL tuning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduce the need to do I/O by managing the workload.</p>

<li>
<p>Gather system statistics with <code>DBMS_STATS</code> package, allowing the query optimizer to accurately cost possible access paths that use full scans.</p>

<li>
<p>Use Automatic Storage Management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add more disks to reduce the number of I/Os for each disk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alleviate I/O hot spots by redistributing I/O across existing disks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The first course of action should be to find opportunities to reduce I/O. Examine the SQL statements being run by sessions waiting for these events and statements causing high physical I/Os from <code>V$SQLAREA</code>. Factors that can adversely affect the execution plans causing excessive I/O include the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p>Improperly optimized SQL</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Missing indexes</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Lack of accurate statistics for the optimizer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Setting the value for <code>DB_FILE_MULTIBLOCK_READ_COUNT</code> initialization parameter too high which favors full scans</p>

<p class="subhead3">Actions</p>
<p>The <code>file_id</code> shows if the reads are for an object in <code>TEMP</code> tablespace (sorts to disk) or full table scans by parallel execution servers. This wait is the largest wait for large data warehouse sites. However, if the workload is not a Decision Support Systems (DSS) workload, then examine why this situation is happening.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Sorts to Disk</span></p>
<p>Examine the SQL statement currently being run by the session experiencing waits to see what is causing the sorts. Query <code>V$TEMPSEG_USAGE</code> to find the SQL statement that is generating the sort. Also query the statistics from <code>V$SESSTAT</code> for the session to determine the size of the sort. See if it is possible to reduce the sorting by tuning the SQL statement. If <code>WORKAREA_SIZE_POLICY</code> is <code>MANUAL</code>, then consider increasing the <code>SORT_AREA_SIZE</code> for the system (if the sorts are not too big) or for individual processes. If <code>WORKAREA_SIZE_POLICY</code> is <code>AUTO</code>, then investigate whether to increase <code>PGA_AGGREGATE_TARGET</code>.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Full Table Scans</span></p>
<p>If tables are defined with a high degree of parallelism, then this setting could skew the optimizer to use full table scans with parallel execution servers. Check the object being read into using the direct path reads. If the full table scans are a valid part of the workload, then ensure that the I/O subsystem is adequate for the degree of parallelism. Consider using disk striping if you are not already using it or Oracle Automatic Storage Management (Oracle ASM).</p>
<p><span class="bold">Hash Area Size</span></p>
<p>For query plans that call for a hash join, excessive I/O could result from having <code>HASH_AREA_SIZE</code> too small.

<p class="subhead3">Actions</p>
<p>The appropriate action depends on the type of enqueue.</p>
<p>If the contended-for enqueue is the ST enqueue, then the problem is most likely to be dynamic space allocation. Oracle Database dynamically allocates an extent to a segment when there is no more free space available in the segment. This enqueue is only used for dictionary managed tablespaces.</p>
<p>To solve contention on this resource:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p>Check to see whether the temporary (that is, sort) tablespace uses <code>TEMPFILES</code>. If not, then switch to using <code>TEMPFILES</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Switch to using locally managed tablespaces if the tablespace that contains segments that are growing dynamically is dictionary managed.</p>
<div class="infoboxnotealso" id="GUID-95757696-4B7B-4D3F-A527-57BF0CCCC029__GUID-CFCE4334-9299-46AD-96F8-5E68183DB889">

<p><a class="olink CNCPT" target="_blank" href="../CNCPT/toc.htm"><span class="italic">Oracle Database Concepts</span></a> for detailed information on <code>TEMPFILE</code>s and locally managed tablespaces</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it is not possible to switch to locally managed tablespaces, then ST enqueue resource usage can be decreased by changing the next extent sizes of the growing objects to be large enough to avoid constant space allocation. To determine which segments are growing constantly, monitor the <code>EXTENTS</code> column of the <code>DBA_SEGMENTS</code> view for all <code>SEGMENT_NAMEs</code>. See <a class="olink ADMIN014" target="_blank" href="../ADMIN/schema.htm#ADMIN014"><span class="italic">Oracle Database Administrator&#39;s Guide</span></a> for information about displaying information about space usage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Preallocate space in the segment, for example, by allocating extents using the <code>ALTER</code> <code>TABLE</code> <code>ALLOCATE</code> <code>EXTENT</code> SQL statement.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The HW enqueue is used to serialize the allocation of space beyond the high water mark of a segment.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p><code>V$SESSION_WAIT.P2</code> / <code>V$LOCK.ID1</code> is the tablespace number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>V$SESSION_WAIT.P3</code> / <code>V$LOCK.ID2</code> is the relative data block address (dba) of segment header of the object for which space is being allocated.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If this is a point of contention for an object, then manual allocation of extents solves the problem.</p>
<p>The most common reason for waits on TM locks tend to involve foreign key constraints where the constrained columns are not indexed. Index the foreign key columns to avoid this problem.</p>
<p>These are acquired exclusive when a transaction initiates its first change and held until the transaction does a <code>COMMIT</code> or <code>ROLLBACK</code>.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p>Waits for TX in mode 6: occurs when a session is waiting for a row level lock that is held by another session. This occurs when one user is updating or deleting a row, which another session wants to update or delete. This type of TX enqueue wait corresponds to the wait event <code>enq:</code> <code>TX</code> <code>-</code> <code>row</code> <code>lock</code> <code>contention</code>.</p>
<p>The solution is to have the first session holding the lock perform a <code>COMMIT</code> or <code>ROLLBACK</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Waits for TX in mode 4 can occur if the session is waiting for an ITL (interested transaction list) slot in a block. This happens when the session wants to lock a row in the block but one or more other sessions have rows locked in the same block, and there is no free ITL slot in the block. Usually, Oracle Database dynamically adds another ITL slot. This may not be possible if there is insufficient free space in the block to add an ITL. If so, the session waits for a slot with a TX enqueue in mode 4. This type of TX enqueue wait corresponds to the wait event <code>enq:</code> <code>TX</code> <code>-</code> <code>allocate</code> <code>ITL</code> <code>entry</code>.</p>
<p>The solution is to increase the number of ITLs available, either by changing the <code>INITRANS</code> or <code>MAXTRANS</code> for the table (either by using an <code>ALTER</code> statement, or by re-creating the table with the higher values).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Waits for TX in mode 4 can also occur if a session is waiting due to potential duplicates in <code>UNIQUE</code> index. If two sessions try to insert the same key value the second session has to wait to see if an <code>ORA-0001</code> should be raised or not. This type of TX enqueue wait corresponds to the wait event <code>enq:</code> <code>TX</code> <code>-</code> <code>row</code> <code>lock</code> <code>contention</code>.</p>
<p>The solution is to have the first session holding the lock perform a <code>COMMIT</code> or <code>ROLLBACK</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Waits for TX in mode 4 can also occur if the session is waiting due to shared bitmap index fragment. Bitmap indexes index key values and a range of rowids. Each entry in a bitmap index can cover many rows in the actual table. If two sessions want to update rows covered by the same bitmap index fragment, then the second session waits for the first transaction to either <code>COMMIT</code> or <code>ROLLBACK</code> by waiting for the TX lock in mode 4. This type of TX enqueue wait corresponds to the wait event <code>enq:</code> <code>TX</code> <code>-</code> <code>row</code> <code>lock</code> <code>contention</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Waits for TX in Mode 4 can also occur waiting for a <code>PREPARED</code> transaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Waits for TX in mode 4 also occur when a transaction inserting a row in an index has to wait for the end of an index block split being done by another transaction. This type of TX enqueue wait corresponds to the wait event <code>enq:</code> <code>TX</code> <code>-</code> <code>index</code> <code>contention</code>.</p>

<div>
<p><a id="d20882e4605" class="indexterm-anchor"></a><a id="d20882e4607" class="indexterm-anchor"></a>This wait event indicates that a server process was unable to find a free buffer and has posted the database writer to make free buffers by writing out dirty buffers. A dirty buffer is a buffer whose contents have been modified. Dirty buffers are freed for reuse when DBWR has written the blocks to disk.</p>
<div class="section">
<p class="subhead3">Causes</p>
<p>DBWR may not be keeping up with writing dirty buffers in the following situations:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p>The I/O system is slow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are resources it is waiting for, such as latches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The buffer cache is so small that DBWR spends most of its time cleaning out buffers for server processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The buffer cache is so big that one DBWR process is not enough to free enough buffers in the cache to satisfy requests.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<!-- class="section" -->
<div class="section">
<p class="subhead3">Actions</p>
<p>If this event occurs frequently, then examine the session waits for DBWR to see whether there is anything delaying DBWR.</p>
<p>If it is waiting for writes, then determine what is delaying the writes and fix it. Check the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p>Examine <code>V$FILESTAT</code> to see where most of the writes are happening.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Examine the host operating system statistics for the I/O system. Are the write times acceptable?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If I/O is slow:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p>Consider using faster I/O alternatives to speed up write times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spread the I/O activity across large number of spindles (disks) and controllers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible DBWR is very active because the cache is too small. Investigate whether this is a probable cause by looking to see if the buffer cache hit ratio is low. Also use the <code>V$DB_CACHE_ADVICE</code> view to determine whether a larger cache size would be advantageous.</p>
<p>If the cache size is adequate and the I/O is evenly spread, then you can potentially modify the behavior of DBWR by using asynchronous I/O or by using multiple database writers.</p>
</div>
<!-- class="section" -->
<div class="section">
<p class="subhead3">Consider Multiple Database Writer (DBWR) Processes or I/O Slaves</p>
<p>Configuring multiple database writer processes, or using I/O slaves, is useful when the transaction rates are high or when the buffer cache size is so large that a single DBW<span class="italic">n</span> process cannot keep up with the load.</p>
<p>The <code>DB_WRITER_PROCESSES</code> initialization parameter lets you configure multiple database writer processes (from DBW0 to DBW9 and from DBWa to DBWj). Configuring multiple DBWR processes distributes the work required to identify buffers to be written, and it also distributes the I/O load over these processes. Multiple db writer processes are highly recommended for systems with multiple CPUs (at least one db writer for every 8 CPUs) or multiple processor groups (at least as many db writers as processor groups).</p>
<p>Based upon the number of CPUs and the number of processor groups, Oracle Database either selects an appropriate default setting for <code>DB_WRITER_PROCESSES</code> or adjusts a user-specified setting.</p>
<p>If it is not practical to use multiple DBWR processes, then Oracle Database provides a facility whereby the I/O load can be distributed over multiple slave processes. The DBWR process is the only process that scans the buffer cache LRU list for blocks to be written out. However, the I/O for those blocks is performed by the I/O slaves. The number of I/O slaves is determined by the parameter <code>DBWR_IO_SLAVES</code>.</p>
<p><code>DBWR_IO_SLAVES</code> is intended for scenarios where you cannot use multiple <code>DB_WRITER_PROCESSES</code> (for example, where you have a single CPU). I/O slaves are also useful when asynchronous I/O is not available, because the multiple I/O slaves simulate nonblocking, asynchronous requests by freeing DBWR to continue identifying blocks in the cache to be written. Asynchronous I/O at the operating system level, if you have it, is generally preferred.</p>
<p>DBWR I/O slaves are allocated immediately following database open when the first I/O request is made. The DBWR continues to perform all of the DBWR-related work, apart from performing I/O. I/O slaves simply perform the I/O on behalf of DBWR. The writing of the batch is parallelized between the I/O slaves.</p>
<div class="infobox-note" id="GUID-01C9C892-4C0B-4524-82B3-146D1C191BDD__GUID-91F2B2EE-C604-44E3-96FE-4684F614C220">
<p class="notep1">Note:</p>
<p>Implementing <code>DBWR_IO_SLAVES</code> requires that extra shared memory be allocated for I/O buffers and request queues. Multiple DBWR processes cannot be used with I/O slaves. Configuring I/O slaves forces only one DBWR process to start.</p>
</div>
<p>Configuring multiple DBWR processes benefits performance when a single DBWR process cannot keep up with the required workload. However, before configuring multiple DBWR processes, check whether asynchronous I/O is available and configured on the system. If the system supports asynchronous I/O but it is not currently used, then enable asynchronous I/O to see if this alleviates the problem. If the system does not support asynchronous I/O, or if asynchronous I/O is configured and there is still a DBWR bottleneck, then configure multiple DBWR processes.</p>
<div class="infobox-note" id="GUID-01C9C892-4C0B-4524-82B3-146D1C191BDD__GUID-24125C74-66A9-4610-BE72-A743790C6E55">
<p class="notep1">Note:</p>
<p>If asynchronous I/O is not available on your platform, then asynchronous I/O can be disabled by setting the <code>DISK_ASYNCH_IO</code> initialization parameter to <code>FALSE</code>.</p>
</div>
<p>Using multiple DBWRs parallelizes the gathering and writing of buffers. Therefore, multiple DBW<span class="italic">n</span> processes should deliver more throughput than one DBWR process with the same number of I/O slaves. For this reason, the use of I/O slaves has been deprecated in favor of multiple DBWR processes. I/O slaves should only be used if multiple DBWR processes cannot be configured.</p>

The majority of the idle events should be ignored when tuning, because they do not indicate the nature of the performance bottleneck.

<div>
<p>A latch is a low-level internal lock used by Oracle Database to protect memory structures. The latch free event is updated when a server process attempts to get a latch, and the latch is unavailable on the first attempt.</p>
<p>There is a dedicated latch-related wait event for the more popular latches that often generate significant contention. For those events, the name of the latch appears in the name of the wait event, such as <code>latch:</code> <code>library</code> <code>cache</code> or <code>latch:</code> <code>cache</code> <code>buffers</code> <code>chains</code>. This enables you to quickly figure out if a particular type of latch is responsible for most of the latch-related contention. Waits for all other latches are grouped in the generic <code>latch</code> <code>free</code> wait event.</p>

<p class="subhead3">Shared Pool and Library Cache Latch Contention</p>
<p>A main cause of shared pool or library cache latch contention is parsing. There are several techniques that you can use to identify unnecessary parsing and several types of unnecessary parsing:</p>
<p>This method identifies similar SQL statements that could be shared if literals were replaced with bind variables. The idea is to either:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p>Manually inspect SQL statements that have only one execution to see whether they are similar:</p>
<pre dir="ltr">SELECT SQL_TEXT
  FROM V$SQLSTATS
 WHERE EXECUTIONS &lt; 4
 ORDER BY SQL_TEXT;
</pre></li>
<li>
<p>Or, automate this process by grouping what may be similar statements. Estimate the number of bytes of a SQL statement that are likely the same, and group the SQL statements by this number of bytes. For example, the following example groups statements that differ only after the first 60 bytes.</p>
<pre dir="ltr">SELECT SUBSTR(SQL_TEXT, 1, 60), COUNT(*)
  FROM V$SQLSTATS
 WHERE EXECUTIONS &lt; 4 
 GROUP BY SUBSTR(SQL_TEXT, 1, 60)
 HAVING COUNT(*) &gt; 1;
</pre></li>
<li>
<p>Or report distinct SQL statements that have the same execution plan. The following query selects distinct SQL statements that share the same execution plan at least four times. These SQL statements are likely to be using literals instead of bind variables.</p>

<p>Check the <code>V$SQLSTATS</code> view. Enter the following query:</p>

<p>When the <code>PARSE_CALLS</code> value is close to the <code>EXECUTIONS</code> value for a given statement, you might be continually reparsing that statement. Tune the statements with the higher numbers of parse calls.</p>
<p>Identify unnecessary parse calls by identifying the session in which they occur. It might be that particular batch programs or certain types of applications do most of the reparsing. To achieve this goal, run the following query:</p>
<pre dir="ltr">SELECT pa.SID, pa.VALUE &#34;Hard Parses&#34;, ex.VALUE &#34;Execute Count&#34; 
  FROM V$SESSTAT pa, V$SESSTAT ex 
 WHERE pa.SID = ex.SID

   AND ex.STATISTIC#=(SELECT STATISTIC# 
       FROM V$STATNAME WHERE NAME = &#39;execute count&#39;) 
   AND pa.VALUE &gt; 0; 
</pre>
<p>The result is a list of all sessions and the amount of reparsing they do. For each session identifier (SID), go to <code>V$SESSION</code> to find the name of the program that causes the reparsing.</p>

<p class="notep1">Note:</p>
<p>Because this query counts all parse calls since instance startup, it is best to look for sessions with high <span class="italic">rates</span> of parse. For example, a connection which has been up for 50 days might show a high parse figure, but a second connection might have been up for 10 minutes and be parsing at a much faster rate.</p>

<p>The output is similar to the following:</p>

<p>The <code>cache</code> <code>buffers</code> <code>lru</code> <code>chain</code> latches protect the lists of buffers in the cache. When adding, moving, or removing a buffer from a list, a latch must be obtained.</p>
<p>For symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) systems, Oracle Database automatically sets the number of LRU latches to a value equal to one half the number of CPUs on the system. For non-SMP systems, one LRU latch is sufficient.</p>
<p>Contention for the <a id="d20882e5413" class="indexterm-anchor"></a>LRU latch can impede performance on SMP computers with a large number of CPUs. LRU latch contention is detected by querying <code>V$LATCH</code>, <code>V$SESSION_EVENT</code>, and <code>V$SYSTEM_EVENT</code>. To avoid contention, consider tuning the application, bypassing the buffer cache for DSS jobs, or redesigning the application.</p>
<p>The <code>cache</code> <code>buffers</code> <code>chains</code> latches are used to protect a buffer list in the buffer cache. These latches are used when searching for, adding, or removing a buffer from the buffer cache. Contention on this latch usually means that there is a block that is greatly contended for (known as a hot block).</p>
<p>To identify the heavily accessed buffer chain, and hence the contended for block, look at latch statistics for the <code>cache</code> <code>buffers</code> <code>chains</code> latches using the view <code>V$LATCH_CHILDREN</code>. If there is a specific <code>cache</code> <code>buffers</code> <code>chains</code> child latch that has many more <code>GETS</code>, <code>MISSES</code>, and <code>SLEEPS</code> when compared with the other child latches, then this is the contended for child latch.</p>
<p>This latch has a memory address, identified by the <code>ADDR</code> column. Use the value in the <code>ADDR</code> column joined with the <code>X$BH</code> table to identify the blocks protected by this latch. For example, given the address (<code>V$LATCH_CHILDREN.ADDR</code>) of a heavily contended latch, this queries the file and block numbers:</p>
<pre dir="ltr">SELECT OBJ data_object_id, FILE#, DBABLK,CLASS, STATE, TCH
  FROM X$BH
 WHERE HLADDR = &#39;address of latch&#39;
  ORDER BY TCH;
</pre>
<p><code>X$BH.TCH</code> is a touch count for the buffer. A high value for <code>X$BH.TCH</code> indicates a hot block.</p>
<p>Many blocks are protected by each latch. One of these buffers will probably be the hot block. Any block with a high <code>TCH</code> value is a potential hot block. Perform this query several times, and identify the block that consistently appears in the output. After you have identified the hot block, query <code>DBA_EXTENTS</code> using the file number and block number, to identify the segment.</p>
<p>After you have identified the hot block, you can identify the segment it belongs to with the following query:</p>
<pre dir="ltr">SELECT OBJECT_NAME, SUBOBJECT_NAME
  FROM DBA_OBJECTS
 WHERE DATA_OBJECT_ID = &amp;obj;
</pre>
<p>In the query, <code>&amp;obj</code> is the value of the <code>OBJ</code> column in the previous query on <code>X$BH</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>row</code> <code>cache</code> <code>objects</code> latches protect the data dictionary.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p>log file switch (archiving needed)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>log file switch (checkpoint incomplete)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In both of the events, the LGWR cannot switch into the next online redo log file. All the commit requests wait for this event.</p>
<div class="section">
<p class="subhead3">Actions</p>
<p>For the <code>log</code> <code>file</code> <code>switch</code> (<code>archiving</code> <code>needed</code>) event, examine why the archiver cannot archive the logs in a timely fashion. It could be due to the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p>Archive destination is running out of free space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Archiver is not able to read redo logs fast enough (contention with the LGWR).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Archiver is not able to write fast enough (contention on the archive destination, or not enough ARCH processes). If you have ruled out other possibilities (such as slow disks or a full archive destination) consider increasing the number of ARCn processes. The default is 2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have mandatory remote shipped archive logs, check whether this process is slowing down because of network delays or the write is not completing because of errors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on the nature of bottleneck, you might need to redistribute I/O or add more space to the archive destination to alleviate the problem. For the <code>log</code> <code>file</code> <code>switch</code> (<code>checkpoint</code> <code>incomplete</code>) event:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p>Check if DBWR is slow, possibly due to an overloaded or slow I/O system. Check the DBWR write times, check the I/O system, and distribute I/O if necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check if there are too few, or too small redo logs. If you have a few redo logs or small redo logs (for example, 2 x 100k logs), and your system produces enough redo to cycle through all of the logs before DBWR has been able to complete the checkpoint, then increase the size or number of redo logs.</p>

<p>If this event&#39;s waits constitute a significant wait on the system or a significant amount of time waited by a user experiencing response time issues or on a system, then examine the average time waited.</p>
<p>If the average time waited is low, but the number of waits are high, then the application might be committing after every <code>INSERT</code>, rather than batching <code>COMMIT</code>s. Applications can reduce the wait by committing after 50 rows, rather than every row.</p>
<p>If the average time waited is high, then examine the session waits for the log writer and see what it is spending most of its time doing and waiting for. If the waits are because of slow I/O, then try the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">

<div>
<p>Instance and crash recovery are the automatic application of redo log records to Oracle data blocks after a crash or system failure. During normal operation, if an instance is shut down cleanly (as when using a <code>SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE</code> statement), rather than terminated abnormally, then the in-memory changes that have not been written to the data files on disk are written to disk as part of the checkpoint performed during shutdown.</p>
<p>However, if a single instance database crashes or if all instances of an Oracle RAC configuration crash, then Oracle Database performs crash recovery at the next startup. If one or more instances of an Oracle RAC configuration crash, then a surviving instance performs instance recovery automatically. Instance and crash recovery occur in two steps: cache recovery followed by transaction recovery.</p>
<p>The database can be opened as soon as cache recovery completes, so improving the performance of cache recovery is important for increasing availability.</p>

<div>
<p>During the cache recovery step, Oracle Database applies all committed and uncommitted changes in the redo log files to the affected data blocks. The work required for cache recovery processing is proportional to the rate of change to the database (update transactions each second) and the time between checkpoints.</p>

<div>
<p>To make the database consistent, the changes that were not committed at the time of the crash must be undone (in other words, rolled back). During the transaction recovery step, Oracle Database applies the rollback segments to undo the uncommitted changes.</p>

<h4 id="TGDBA-GUID-FFF3AFCE-2A3F-4F7B-A22E-67260849D237" class="sect4">Checkpoints and Cache Recovery</h4>
<div>
<p>Periodically, Oracle Database records a checkpoint. A <span class="bold">checkpoint</span> is the highest system change number (SCN) such that all data blocks less than or equal to that SCN are known to be written out to the data files. If a failure occurs, then only the redo records containing changes at SCNs higher than the checkpoint need to be applied during recovery. The duration of cache recovery processing is determined by two factors: the number of data blocks that have changes at SCNs higher than the SCN of the checkpoint, and the number of log blocks that need to be read to find those changes.</p>
<div class="section">
<p class="subhead3">How Checkpoints Affect Performance</p>
<p>Frequent checkpointing writes dirty buffers to the data files more often than otherwise, and so reduces cache recovery time in the event of an instance failure. If checkpointing is frequent, then applying the redo records in the redo log between the current checkpoint position and the end of the log involves processing relatively few data blocks. This means that the cache recovery phase of recovery is fairly short.</p>
<p>However, in a high-update system, frequent checkpointing can reduce run-time performance, because checkpointing causes DBW<span class="italic">n</span> processes to perform writes.</p>

<p>To minimize the duration of cache recovery, you must force Oracle Database to checkpoint often, thus keeping the number of redo log records to be applied during recovery to a minimum. However, in a high-update system, frequent checkpointing increases the overhead for normal database operations.</p>
<p>If daily operational efficiency is more important than minimizing recovery time, then decrease the frequency of writes to data files due to checkpoints. This should improve operational efficiency, but also increase cache recovery time.</p>

<p>The foundation of Fast-Start Fault Recovery is the Fast-Start checkpointing architecture. Instead of conventional event-driven (that is, log switching) checkpointing, which does bulk writes, fast-start checkpointing occurs incrementally. Each DBW<span class="italic">n</span> process periodically writes buffers to disk to advance the checkpoint position. The oldest modified blocks are written first to ensure that every write lets the checkpoint advance. Fast-Start checkpointing eliminates bulk writes and the resultant I/O spikes that occur with conventional checkpointing.</p>
<p>With the Fast-Start Fault Recovery feature, the <code>FAST_START_MTTR_TARGET</code> initialization parameter simplifies the configuration of recovery time from instance or system failure. <code>FAST_START_MTTR_TARGET</code> specifies a target for the expected mean time to recover (MTTR), that is, the time (in seconds) that it should take to start up the instance and perform cache recovery. After <code>FAST_START_MTTR_TARGET</code> is set, the database manages incremental checkpoint writes in an attempt to meet that target. If you have chosen a practical value for <code>FAST_START_MTTR_TARGET</code>, you can expect your database to recover, on average, in approximately the number of seconds you have chosen.</p>

<p class="notep1">Note:</p>
<p>You must disable or remove the <code>FAST_START_IO_TARGET</code>, <code>LOG_CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL</code>, and <code>LOG_CHECKPOINT_TIMEOUT</code> initialization parameters when using <code>FAST_START_MTTR_TARGET</code>.

<div>
<p>The maximum value for <code>FAST_START_MTTR_TARGET</code> is 3600 seconds (one hour). If you set the value to more than 3600, then Oracle Database rounds it to 3600.</p>
<p>The following example shows how to set the value of <code>FAST_START_MTTR_TARGET</code>:</p>
<pre dir="ltr">SQL&gt; ALTER SYSTEM SET FAST_START_MTTR_TARGET=30;
</pre>
<p>In principle, the minimum value for <code>FAST_START_MTTR_TARGET</code> is one second. However, the fact that you can set <code>FAST_START_MTTR_TARGET</code> this low does not mean that this target can be achieved. There are practical limits to the minimum achievable MTTR target, due to such factors as database startup time.</p>
<p>The MTTR target that your database can achieve given the current value of <code>FAST_START_MTTR_TARGET</code> is called the <span class="bold">effective MTTR target</span>. You can view your current effective MTTR by viewing the <code>TARGET_MTTR</code> column of the <code>V$INSTANCE_RECOVERY</code> view.</p>
<p>The practical range of MTTR target values for your database is defined to be the range between the lowest achievable effective MTTR target for your database and the longest that startup and cache recovery will take in the worst-case scenario (that is, when the whole buffer cache is dirty). <span class="q">&#34;<a href="pfgrf_instance_tune.htm#GUID-63DE4C5C-6FDF-4FBB-A8D4-CD5DB54E15D5">Determine the Practical Range for FAST_START_MTTR_TARGET</a>&#34;</span> describes the procedure for determining the range of achievable MTTR target values, one step in the process of tuning your <code>FAST_START_MTTR_TARGET</code> value.</p>

<p class="notep1">Note:</p>
<p>It is usually not useful to set your <code>FAST_START_MTTR_TARGET</code> to a value outside the practical range. If your <code>FAST_START_MTTR_TARGET</code> value is shorter than the lower limit of the practical range, the effect is as if you set it to the lower limit of the practical range. In such a case, the effective MTTR target will be the best MTTR target the system can achieve, but checkpointing will be at a maximum, which can affect normal database performance. If you set <code>FAST_START_MTTR_TARGET</code> to a time longer than the practical range, the MTTR target will be no better than the worst-case situation.</p>

<div>
<p>The <code>FAST_START_MTTR_TARGET</code> initialization parameter causes the database to calculate internal system trigger values, in order to limit the length of the redo log and the number of dirty data buffers in the data cache. This calculation uses estimated time to read a redo block, estimates of the time to read and write a data block and characteristics of typical workload of the system, such as how many dirty buffers corresponds to how many change vectors, and so on.</p>
<p>Initially, internal defaults are used in the calculation. These defaults are replaced over time by data gathered on I/O performance during system operation and actual cache recoveries.</p>
<p>You will have to perform several instance recoveries in order to calibrate your <code>FAST_START_MTTR_TARGET</code> value properly. Before starting calibration, you must decide whether <code>FAST_START_MTTR_TARGET</code> is being calibrated for a database crash or a hardware crash. This is a consideration if your database files are stored in a file system or if your I/O subsystem has a memory cache, because there is a considerable difference in the read and write time to disk depending on whether the files are cached. The appropriate value for <code>FAST_START_MTTR_TARGET</code> will depend upon which type of crash is more important to recover from quickly.</p>
<p>To effectively calibrate <code>FAST_START_MTTR_TARGET</code>, ensure that you run the typical workload of the system for long enough, and perform several instance recoveries to ensure that the time to read a redo block and the time to read or write a data block during recovery are recorded accurately.</p>

<div>
<div class="section">
<p>To determine the lower bound of the practical range, set <code>FAST_START_MTTR_TARGET</code> to 1, and start up your database. Then check the value of <code>V$INSTANCE_RECOVERY.TARGET_MTTR</code>, and use this value as a good lower bound for <code>FAST_START_MTTR_TARGET</code>. Database startup time, rather than cache recovery time, is usually the dominant factor in determining this limit.</p>
<p>For example, set the <code>FAST_START_MTTR_TARGET</code> to 1:</p>
<pre dir="ltr">SQL&gt; ALTER SYSTEM SET FAST_START_MTTR_TARGET=1;
</pre>
<p>Then, execute the following query immediately after opening the database:</p>
<pre dir="ltr">SQL&gt; SELECT TARGET_MTTR, ESTIMATED_MTTR 
    FROM V$INSTANCE_RECOVERY;
</pre>
<p>Oracle Database responds with the following:</p>
<pre dir="ltr">TARGET_MTTR ESTIMATED_MTTR 
18          15             
</pre>
<p>The <code>TARGET_MTTR</code> value of 18 seconds is the minimum MTTR target that the system can achieve, that is, the lowest practical value for <code>FAST_START_MTTR_TARGET</code>. This minimum is calculated based on the average database startup time.</p>
<p>The <code>ESTIMATED_MTTR</code> field contains the estimated mean time to recovery based on the current state of the running database. Because the database has just opened, the system contains few dirty buffers, so not much cache recovery would be required if the instance failed at this moment. That is why <code>ESTIMATED_MTTR</code> can, for the moment, be lower than the minimum possible <code>TARGET_MTTR</code>.</p>
<p><code>ESTIMATED_MTTR</code> can be affected in the short term by recent database activity. Assume that you query <code>V$INSTANCE_RECOVERY</code> immediately after a period of heavy update activity in the database. Oracle Database responds with the following:</p>
<pre dir="ltr">TARGET_MTTR ESTIMATED_MTTR 
18          30             
</pre>
<p>Now the effective MTTR target is still 18 seconds, and the estimated MTTR (if a crash happened at that moment) is 30 seconds. This is an acceptable result. This means that some checkpoints writes might not have finished yet, so the buffer cache contains more dirty buffers than targeted.</p>
<p>Now wait for sixty seconds and reissue the query to <code>V$INSTANCE_RECOVERY</code>. Oracle Database responds with the following:</p>
<pre dir="ltr">TARGET_MTTR ESTIMATED_MTTR 
18          25             
</pre>
<p>The estimated MTTR at this time has dropped to 25 seconds, because some of the dirty buffers have been written out during this period</p>

<p>For example, if you discovered that the practical range was between 17 and 19 seconds, it would be quite simple to choose 19, because it makes relatively little difference in recovery time and at the same time minimizes the effect of checkpointing on system performance.

<p>Note, however, that the redo log file size affects the MTTR. In some cases, you may be able to refine your choice of the optimal <code>FAST_START_MTTR_TARGET</code> value by re-running the MTTR Advisor with your suggested optimal log file size.</p>
