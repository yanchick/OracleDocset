<p>The image contrasts the paths of an application request to a disk-based RDBMS and TimesTen.</p>
<p>In the disk-based RDBMS, the application uses a SQL statement to initiate a request for a record. The statement is passed over an IPC connection to a query optimizer, which uses table numbers and page number to locates the pointer to a page in the buffer pool by using hashing and linear search methods. The record is copied into a private buffer and then passed across an IPC connection to the application.</p>
<p>In Timesten, the application also uses a SQL statement to initiate a request for a record. The statement is passed by direct link to a query optimizer, which determines the memory address of the record. The database has already been loaded from checkpoint files on disk into memory. The record is copied into the application buffer and returned to the application.</p>
