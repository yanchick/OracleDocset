This book is for an old release of SQL Developer. You are encouraged to use the latest available release. See <code><a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/sql-developer/">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/sql-developer/</a></code> for information about downloads and documentation.</div>
<p>Oracle SQL Developer is a graphical version of SQL*Plus that gives database developers a convenient way to perform basic tasks. You can browse, create, edit, and delete (drop) database objects; run SQL statements and scripts; edit and debug PL/SQL code; manipulate and export (unload) data; and view and create reports.</p>
<p>You can connect to any target Oracle database schema using standard Oracle database authentication. Once connected, you can perform operations on objects in the database.</p>
<p>You can connect to schemas for selected third-party (non-Oracle) databases, such as MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Sybase Adaptive Server, Microsoft Access, and IBM DB2, and view metadata and data in these databases; and you can migrate third-party databases to Oracle.</p>

<h2 class="sect1"><span class="secnum">1.1</span> Installing and Getting Started with SQL Developer</h2>
<p>To install and start SQL Developer, you simply download a ZIP file and unzip it into a desired parent directory or folder, and then type a command or double-click a file name. You should read the <a class="olink RPTIG" href="http://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=E50529-01&amp;id=RPTIG"><span class="italic">Oracle SQL Developer Installation Guide</span></a> before you perform the installation. After you have read the installation guide, the basic steps are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Unzip the SQL Developer kit into a directory (folder) of your choice. This directory location will be referred to as <code><span class="codeinlineitalic">&lt;sqldeveloper_install&gt;</span></code>.</p>
<p>Unzipping the SQL Developer kit causes a directory named <code>sqldeveloper</code> to be created under the <code><span class="codeinlineitalic">&lt;sqldeveloper_install&gt;</span></code> directory. It also causes many files and folders to be placed in and under that directory.</p>
<p><span class="bold">If Oracle Database (Release 11 or later) is also installed</span>, a version of SQL Developer is also included and is accessible through the menu system under Oracle. This version of SQL Developer is separate from any SQL Developer kit that you download and unzip on your own, so do not confuse the two, and do not unzip a kit over the SQL Developer files that are included with Oracle Database. Suggestion: Create a shortcut for the SQL Developer executable file that you install, and always use it to start SQL Developer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To start SQL Developer, go to the <code>sqldeveloper</code> directory under the <code><span class="codeinlineitalic">&lt;sqldeveloper_install&gt;</span></code> directory, and do one of the following:</p>
<p>On Linux and Mac OS X systems, run <span class="italic">sh sqldeveloper.sh</span>.</p>
<p>On Windows systems, double-click <code>sqldeveloper.exe</code>.</p>
<p><a id="sthref21"></a><a id="sthref22"></a><a id="sthref23"></a>If you are asked to enter the full pathname for java.exe, click <span class="bold">Browse</span> and find java.exe. For example, on a Windows system the path might have a name similar to <code>C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_06\bin\java.exe</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to become familiar with SQL Developer concepts before using the interface, read the rest of this chapter before proceeding to the next step.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create at least one database connection (or import some previously exported connections), so that you can view and work with database objects, use the SQL Worksheet, and use other features.</p>
<p>To create a new database connection, right-click the <span class="bold">Connections</span> node in the Connections navigator, select <span class="bold">New Connection</span>, and complete the required entries in the <a href="dialogs.htm#BACICJAF">Create/Edit/Select Database Connection</a> dialog box.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to get started quickly with SQL Developer, do the short tutorial in <a href="tut_library.htm#CBAHDFAF">Chapter 4, &#34;SQL Developer Tutorial: Creating Objects for a Small Database&#34;</a>, or work with your existing database objects.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="sect1"><span class="secnum">1.2</span> <a id="sthref24"></a><a id="sthref25"></a>SQL Developer User Interface</h2>
<p>The SQL Developer window generally uses the left side for navigation to find and select objects, and the right side to display information about selected objects.</p>
<p><a href="#BABCHFGH">Figure 1-1</a> shows the main window.</p>
<div id="RPTUG41303" class="figure">

<!-- class="figure" -->
<div class="infobox-note">
<p class="notep1">Note:</p>
This text explains the default interface. However, you can customize many aspects of the appearance and behavior of SQL Developer by setting preferences (see <a href="#CHDEDCJD">Section 1.18</a>). If you ever need to restore the default interface, see <a href="#CHDBHFIA">Section 1.2.2, &#34;Restoring the Original &#34;Look and Feel&#34;&#34;</a>.</div>
<div class="infobox-note">
<p class="notep1">Note:</p>
For migration of third-party databases to Oracle, see also <a href="migration.htm#CHDFHCEH">Section 2.3, &#34;SQL Developer User Interface for Migration&#34;</a>.</div>
<p>The menus at the top contain standard entries, plus entries for features specific to SQL Developer (see <a href="#CHDDHJBA">Section 1.2.1, &#34;Menus for SQL Developer&#34;</a>), as shown in the following figure.</p>
<img width="365" height="52" src="img/ui_top.gif" alt="Top of the window: menus and icons"/><br/>
<p><a id="sthref26"></a><a id="sthref27"></a><a id="sthref28"></a>You can use <span class="bold">shortcut keys</span> to access menus and menu items: for example Alt+F for the File menu and Alt+E for the Edit menu; or Alt+H, then Alt+S for Help, then Search. You can also display the File menu by pressing the F10 key (except in the SQL Worksheet, where F10 is the shortcut for Explain Plan).</p>
<p><a id="sthref29"></a>To close a window that has focus (such as the SQL Developer main window, a wizard or dialog box, or the Help Center) and any of its dependent windows, you can press Alt+F4.</p>
<p>Icons under the menus perform various actions, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">New</span> creates a new database object (see <a href="dialogs.htm#BACBBDCB">Section 5.17, &#34;Create New Object&#34;</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Open</span> opens a file (see <a href="dialogs.htm#BACCGAAG">Section 5.125, &#34;Open File&#34;</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Save</span> saves any changes to the currently selected object.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Save All</span> saves any changes to all open objects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Back</span> moves to the pane that you most recently visited. (Or use the drop-down arrow to specify a tab view.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Forward</span> moves to the pane after the current one in the list of visited panes. (Or use the drop-down arrow to specify a tab view.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Open SQL Worksheet</span> opens the SQL Worksheet (see <a href="#CHDDHAAI">Using the SQL Worksheet</a>). If you do not use the drop-down arrow to specify the database connection to use, you are asked to select a connection.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The left side of the SQL Developer window has tabs and panes for the Connections and Reports navigators, icons for performing actions, and a hierarchical tree display for the currently selected navigator, as shown in the following figure.</p>
<img width="229" height="222" src="img/ui_left.gif" alt="Left side of window: navigation"/><br/>
<p>The <span class="bold">Connections navigator</span> lists database connections that have been created. To create a new database connection, import an XML file with connection definitions, or export or edit current connections, right-click the Connections node and select the appropriate menu item. (For more information, see <a href="#CHDHIFGJ">Section 1.4, &#34;Database Connections&#34;</a>.)</p>
<p><a id="sthref30"></a>The <span class="bold">Files navigator</span> (marked by a folder icon; not shown in the preceding figure) displays your local file system using a standard hierarchy of folders and files. You can double-click or drag and drop files to open them, and you can edit and save the files. For example, if you open a .sql file, it is displayed in a SQL Worksheet window. The Files navigator is especially useful if you are using versioning with SQL Developer (see <a href="#CHDIICEH">Section 1.10, &#34;Using Versioning&#34;</a>).</p>
<p>The <span class="bold">Reports navigator</span> lists informative reports provided by SQL Developer, such as a list of tables without primary keys for each database connection, as well as any user-defined reports. (For more information, see <a href="#CHDBJIBJ">Section 1.17, &#34;SQL Developer Reports&#34;</a>.)</p>
<p>Icons under the Connections tab (above the metadata tree) perform the following actions on the currently selected object:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Refresh</span> queries the database for the current details about the selected object (for example, a connection or just a table).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold"><a id="sthref31"></a><a id="sthref32"></a><a id="sthref33"></a>Apply Filter</span> restricts the display of objects using a filter that you specify. For example, you can right-click the Tables node and specify a filter of EM% to see only tables that start with <span class="italic">EM</span> and to have the Tables node label be changed to <span class="italic">Tables (EM%)</span>. To remove the effects of applying a filter, right-click the node and select <span class="bold">Clear Filter</span>.</p>
<p>Note that for tables, the initial default node label is <span class="italic">Tables (Filtered)</span>, to reflect the exclusion of tables that are in the Recycle Bin. To have such tables included in the display, clear the filter.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The metadata tree in the Connections pane displays all the objects (categorized by object type) accessible to the defined connections. To select an object, expand the appropriate tree node or nodes, then click the object.</p>
<p>The right side of the SQL Developer window has tabs and panes for objects that you select or open, as shown in the following figure, which displays information about a table named BOOKS. (If you hold the mouse pointer over the tab label -- BOOKS in this figure -- a tooltip displays the object&#39;s owner and the database connection.)</p>
<img width="394" height="194" src="img/ui_right.gif" alt="Right side of the window: details about selected objects"/><br/>
<p>For objects other than subprograms, icons provide the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Freeze View</span> <a id="sthref34"></a><a id="sthref35"></a>(the <span class="bold">pin</span>) keeps that object&#39;s tab and information in the window when you click another object in the Connections navigator; a separate tab and display are created for that other object. If you click the pin again, the object&#39;s display is available for reuse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Edit</span> displays a dialog box for editing the object.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Refresh</span> updates the display by querying the database for the latest information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Actions</span> displays a menu with actions appropriate for the object. The actions are the same as when you right-click an object of that type in the Connections navigator, except the Actions menu does not include Edit.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To switch among objects, click the desired tabs; to close a tab, click the X in the tab. If you make changes to an object and click the X, you are asked if you want to save the changes.</p>
<p>For tables and views, this information is grouped under tabs, which are labeled near the top. For example, for tables the tabs are Columns, Data (for seeing and modifying the data itself), Indexes, Constraints, and so on; and you can click a column heading under a tab to sort the grid rows by the values in that column. For most objects, the tabs include SQL, which displays the SQL statement for creating the object.</p>
<p>You can export (unload) data from a detail pane or from the results of a SQL Worksheet operation or a report by using the context menu and selecting <span class="bold">Export</span>.</p>
<p>The <span class="bold">Messages - Log</span> area is used for feedback information as appropriate (for example, results of an action, or error or warning messages). If this area is not already visible, you can display is by clicking View and then Log.</p>
<p>The <span class="bold">Compiler - Log</span> area is used for any messages displayed as a result of a Compile or Compile for Debug operation.</p>

<p>If you have made changes to the SQL Developer user interface (&#34;look and feel&#34;), such as accidentally repositioning navigators and panes, you can restore the interface to the way it was after SQL Developer was installed by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you are running SQL Developer, exit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a backup copy of the folder or directory where your SQL Developer user information is stored, in case you want to restore any old user-defined reports, snippets, code templates, or SQL history. The default location is a build-specific directory or folder under the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Windows: C:\Documents and Settings\<span class="italic">&lt;user-name&gt;</span>\Application Data\SQL Developer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Linux or Mac OS X: ~/.sqldeveloper</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have specified a nondefault location for your SQL Developer user information (see <a href="#CIHFCGCD">Section 1.19</a>), create the backup copy of that folder or directory instead.</p>
<p>(If you do not want to use any old information or settings, you can skip creating a backup copy.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delete the original (not the backup) folder or directory where your user information is stored (explained in step 2).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start SQL Developer.</p>
<p>This creates a folder or directory where your user information is stored (explained in step 2), which has the same content as when SQL Developer was installed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have made changes to the SQL Developer shortcut key (accelerator key) mappings, you can restore the mappings to the defaults for your system by clicking <span class="bold">Tools</span>, then <span class="bold">Preferences</span>, then <span class="bold">Shortcut Keys</span>, then <span class="bold">More Actions</span>, then <span class="bold">Load Keyboard Scheme</span>, and then selecting <span class="bold">Default</span>.</p>

<p>You can create, edit, and delete (drop) most types of objects in an Oracle database by using the context menu (right-click, or Shift+F10) in the Connections navigator or by clicking the <span class="bold">Actions</span> button in the detail pane display. For some objects, you can do other operations, as appropriate for the object type.</p>
<p><a id="sthref46"></a><a id="sthref47"></a>For some object types the context menu includes <span class="bold">Open</span>, which generates a tabular overview display of information about objects of that type. For example, selecting <span class="bold">Open</span> for the Tables node in the Connections navigator displays a list of all tables for the connection, and for each table the table name, the number of rows, the table status, the number of columns, the comment (if any), and other information.</p>
<div class="infobox-note">
<p class="notep1">Note:</p>
The actions available from context menus and Actions buttons depend on the Oracle Database release number for the specified database connection. If an action mentioned in the text is not available with a connection, it may be that the feature was not available in that release of Oracle Database.</div>
<p>The dialog boxes for creating and editing many objects contain a tab or pane named <span class="bold">DDL</span> or <span class="bold">SQL</span>, where you can see the statement that SQL Developer will use to perform the actions you specify (CREATE to create an object, ALTER to apply changes to an existing object).</p>
<p>You can search for specific objects associated with an Oracle database connection by clicking the Search icon, as explained in <a href="#CHDGFGFJ">Section 1.9, &#34;Finding Database Objects&#34;</a>.</p>
<p>If you have connected to any third-party (non-Oracle) databases, such as MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Sybase Adaptive Server, Microsoft Access, or IBM DB2, you can view their objects using the Connections navigator.

<p>A chain is an Oracle Scheduler object that enables you to implement dependency scheduling, in which jobs are started depending on the outcomes of one or more previous jobs. A chain consists of multiple steps that are combined using dependency rules. The dependency rules define the conditions that can be used to start or stop a step or the chain itself. Conditions can include the success, failure, or completion-codes or exit-codes of previous steps. Logical expressions, such as AND/OR, can be used in the conditions. In a sense, a chain resembles a decision tree, with many possible paths for selecting which tasks run and when.</p>

<p>A database link is a database object in one database that enables you to access objects on another database. The other database need not be an Oracle Database system; however, to access non-Oracle systems you must use Oracle Heterogeneous Services. After you have created a database link, you can use it to refer to tables and views in the other database. The Connections navigator has a <span class="bold">Database Links</span> node for all database links (public and private) owned by the user associated with the specified connection, and a <span class="bold">Public Database Links</span> node for all public database links on the database associated with the connection. For help with specific options in creating a database link, see <a href="dialogs.htm#BACIAAAE">Section 5.39, &#34;Create/Edit Database Link&#34;</a>.</p>

<p>A directory object specifies an alias for a directory (called a folder on Windows systems) on the server file system where external binary file LOBs (BFILEs) and external table data are located. To create a directory (that is, a directory object), you can use SQL Developer or the SQL statement CREATE DIRECTORY.</p>
<p>You can use directory names when referring to BFILEs in your PL/SQL code and OCI calls, rather than hard coding the operating system path name, for management flexibility. All directories are created in a single namespace and are not owned by an individual schema. You can secure access to the BFILEs stored within the directory structure by granting object privileges on the directories to specific users.</p>

<p>Edition-based redefinition, introduced in Oracle Database 11<span class="italic">g</span> Release 2 (11.2), enables you to upgrade the database component of an application while it is in use, thereby minimizing or eliminating down time. To upgrade an application while it is in use, you copy the database objects that comprise the application and redefine the copied objects in isolation. Your changes do not affect users of the application&mdash;they continue to run the unchanged application. When you are sure that your changes are correct, you make the upgraded application available to all users.

<p>A file watcher is an Oracle Scheduler object that defines the location, name, and other properties of a file whose arrival on a system causes the Scheduler to start a job. You create a file watcher and then create any number of event-based jobs or event schedules that reference the file watcher. When the file watcher detects the arrival of the designated file, it raises a file arrival event. The job started by the file arrival event can retrieve the event message to learn about the newly arrived file.</p>

<p>An index is a database object that contains an entry for each value that appears in the indexed column(s) of the table or cluster and provides direct, fast access to rows. Indexes are automatically created on primary key columns; however, you must create indexes on other columns to gain the benefits of indexing. For help with specific options in creating an index, see <a href="dialogs.htm#BACEAJAD">Section 5.40, &#34;Create/Edit Index&#34;</a>.</p>

<p>A materialized view is a database object that contains the results of a query. The FROM clause of the query can name tables, views, and other materialized views. Collectively these objects are called master tables (a replication term) or detail tables (a data warehousing term). This reference uses &#34;master tables&#34; for consistency. The databases containing the master tables are called the master databases.

<p>A materialized view log is a table associated with the master table of a materialized view. When DML changes are made to master table data, Oracle Database stores rows describing those changes in the materialized view log and then uses the materialized view log to refresh materialized views based on the master table. This process is called incremental or fast refresh. Without a materialized view log, Oracle Database must reexecute the materialized view query to refresh the materialized view. This process is called a complete refresh. Usually, a fast refresh takes less time than a complete refresh.</p>

<p>A data type associates a fixed set of properties with the values that can be used in a column of a table or in an argument of a function or procedure. These properties cause Oracle Database to treat values of one data type differently from values of another data type. Most data types are supplied by Oracle, although users can create data types.</p>

<p>Database users are accounts through which you can log in to the database. In the Connections navigator, you can see the <span class="bold">Other Users</span> in the database associated with a connection, but the database objects that you are allowed to see for each user are determined by the privileges of the database user associated with the current database connection.</p>
<p>If you are connected as a user with the DBA role, you can create a database user by right-clicking Other Users and selecting <span class="bold">Create User</span>, and you can edit an existing database user by right-clicking the user under Other Users and selecting <span class="bold">Edit User</span>.

<p>Views are virtual tables (analogous to queries in some database products) that select data from one or more underlying tables. Oracle Database provides many view creation options and specialized types of views (such as materialized views, described in <a href="#CHDGAAAI">Section 1.3.16, &#34;Materialized Views&#34;</a>), to meet a variety of enterprise needs. For help with specific options in creating and editing a view, see <a href="dialogs.htm#BACGJIGG">Create/Edit View</a>.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Editioning views</span> are shown in a separate navigator node if the connection is to an Oracle Database release that supports <a href="#CHDGBDIJ">Editions</a>. An editioning view selects a subset of the columns from a single base table and, optionally, provides aliases for them. In providing aliases, the editioning view maps physical column names (used by the base table) to logical column names (used by the application).

<p>A <span class="bold">connection</span> is a SQL Developer object that specifies the necessary information for connecting to a specific database as a specific user of that database. You must have at least one database connection (existing, created, or imported) to use SQL Developer.</p>
<p>You can connect to any target Oracle database schema using standard Oracle database authentication. Once connected, you can perform operations on objects in the database. You can also connect to schemas for selected third-party (non-Oracle) databases, such as MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Sybase Adaptive Server, Microsoft Access, and IBM DB2, and view metadata and data.</p>
<p><a id="sthref162"></a>When you start SQL Developer and whenever you display the database connections dialog box, SQL Developer automatically reads any connections defined in the tnsnames.ora file on your system, if that file exists. You can specify the tnsnames.ora location in the <a href="#CHDFGCAC">Database: Advanced</a> preferences.By default, tnsnames.ora is located in the $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin directory, but it can also be in the directory specified by the TNS_ADMIN environment variable or registry value or (on Linux systems) the global configuration directory. On Windows systems, if the tnsnames.ora file exists but its connections are not being used by SQL Developer, define TNS_ADMIN as a system environment variable. For information about the tnsnames.ora file, see the &#34;Local Naming Parameters (tnsnames.ora)&#34; chapter in <span class="italic">Oracle Database Net Services Reference</span>.</p>
<p>You can create additional connections (for example, to connect to the same database but as different users, or to connect to different databases). Each database connection is listed in the Connections navigator hierarchy.</p>
<p>To create a new database connection, right-click the Connections node and select <span class="bold">New Database Connection</span>. Use the dialog box to specify information about the connection (see <a href="dialogs.htm#BACICJAF">Section 5.21, &#34;Create/Edit/Select Database Connection&#34;</a>). You can also create a new database connection by selecting an existing connection in that dialog box, changing the connection name, changing other connection attributes as needed, and clicking Save or Connect.</p>
<p><a id="sthref163"></a><a id="sthref164"></a><a id="sthref165"></a><a id="sthref166"></a>To create (automatically generate) a database connection for each unlocked user account in the Oracle database instance on the local system, right-click the Connections node and select <span class="bold">Create Local Connections</span>. The connections are placed in a folder named <span class="italic">Auto-Generated Local Connections</span>. Note that for these autogenerated connections (except for the one named <code>system-</code><code><span class="codeinlineitalic">&lt;database-name&gt;</span></code>), you will always be prompted for the password when you connect, and you cannot edit the user name or password in the connection properties dialog box.</p>
<p>To edit the information about an existing database connection, right-click the connection name in the Connections navigator display and select <span class="bold">Properties</span>. Use the dialog box to modify information about the connection, but do not change the connection name. (See <a href="dialogs.htm#BACICJAF">Section 5.21, &#34;Create/Edit/Select Database Connection&#34;</a>.)</p>
<p>To organize connection groups using folders, see <a href="#CHDJDGIJ">Section 1.4.1, &#34;Using Folders to Group Connections&#34;</a>.</p>
<p>To export information about the existing database connections into an XML file that you can later use for importing connections, right-click Connections in the Connections navigator display and select <span class="bold">Export Connections</span>. Use the dialog box to specify the connections to be exported (see <a href="dialogs.htm#BACBDDIA">Section 5.36, &#34;Export/Import Connection Descriptors&#34;</a>).</p>
<p>To import connections that had previously been exported (adding them to any connections that may already exist in SQL Developer), right-click Connections in the Connections navigator display and select <span class="bold">Import Connections</span>. Use the dialog box to specify the connections to be imported (see <a href="dialogs.htm#BACBDDIA">Section 5.36, &#34;Export/Import Connection Descriptors&#34;</a>).</p>
<p>To perform limited database management operations if you are connected AS SYSDBA, right-click the connection name in the Connections navigator display and select <span class="bold">Manage Database</span>. You can click to refresh the read-only display of memory (SGA and PGA) and tablespace information. If a listener is running with a static listener configured for the database, you can also click to start and stop the database.</p>
<p>To perform remote debugging if you are using the Sun Microsystem&#39;s Java Platform Debugger Architecture (JPDA) and you would like the debugger to listen so that a debuggee can attach to the debugger, right-click the connection name in the Connections navigator display and select <span class="bold">Remote Debug</span>. Use the dialog box to specify remote debugging information (see <a href="dialogs.htm#BACHGIHJ">Section 5.75, &#34;Debugger - Attach to JPDA&#34;</a>).</p>

<p>By default, each connection in SQL Developer is shared when possible. For example, if you open a table in the Connections navigator and two SQL Worksheets using the same connection, all three panes use one shared connection to the database. In this example, a commit operation in one SQL Worksheet commits across all three panes. If you want a dedicated session, you must duplicate your connection and give it another name. Sessions are shared by name, not connection information, so this new connection will be kept separate from the original.</p>

<p>Proxy authentication enables one JDBC connection to act as a proxy for other JDBC connections. If you use the Proxy Connection option when you create a database connection, the connection will be used to connect as the specified user for the connection, but authenticated using the user name and either the password or distinguished name of the proxy user. For information about using a middle tier server for proxy authentication, see <a class="olink DBSEG33101" href="../DBSEG/authentication.htm#DBSEG33101"><span class="italic">Oracle Database Security Guide</span></a>.</p>
<p>For example, to create connection for a user named PROXY_USER but connecting using the user name and password of existing database user SCOTT, follow these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Create the proxy user and grant it the appropriate privileges:</p>
<pre>CREATE USER proxy_user IDENTIFIED BY &lt;password&gt;;
ALTER USER proxy_user GRANT CONNECT THROUGH scott AUTHENTICATED USING PASSWORD;
GRANT create session TO proxy_user;
. . .&lt;Grant other privileges as needed.&gt;
</pre></li>
<li>
<p>Create a new database connection. For example: connection name = proxy_conn, user name = scott, password = <span class="italic">&lt;password for scott&gt;</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable (check) <span class="bold">Proxy Connection</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Oracle Proxy Connection dialog box, select <span class="bold">User Name</span> for Proxy Type</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For Proxy User, enter <span class="bold">PROXY_USER</span>; and for Proxy Password, enter the password for the PROXY_USER database user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click OK to close the Oracle Proxy Connection dialog box.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complete any other necessary connection information, and click Connect to create the connection.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In this example, when you connect using the proxy_conn connection, the user name and password for user SCOTT are used to connect to the database, but the connection sees those database objects that the PROXY_USER user is permitted to see.</p>
<p>The preceding instructions cause two sessions to be started (one for the proxy user and one for the proxy client) when the connection is opened. If you want to have a single session (with no second password or distinguished name required) started, you can follow these steps instead after you create the proxy user and grant it appropriate privileges:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Create a new database connection. For example: connection name = proxy_conn, user name = proxy_user[scott], password = <span class="italic">&lt;password for proxy_user&gt;</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For Connection Type, specify <span class="bold">TNS</span>.</p>
<p>(Note: Do <span class="bolditalic">not</span> enable Proxy Connection.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For Network Alias, select the network alias for the database for the connection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complete any other necessary connection information, and click Connect to create the connection.</p>

<p>You can use SQL Developer to run and debug PL/SQL subprograms (functions and procedures).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To run a subprogram, click its name in the Connections navigator; then either right-click and select Run, or click the Edit icon and then click the Run icon above its source listing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To debug a subprogram, click its name in the Connections navigator. If the procedure in its current form has not already been compiled for debug, right-click and select Compile for Debug. Then click the Edit icon and click the Debug icon above its source listing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In both cases, a code editing window is displayed. The following figure shows the code editing window being used to debug a procedure named LIST_A_RATING2, which is used for tutorial purposes in <a href="tut_library.htm#CBACAEJG">Section 4.8, &#34;Debug a PL/SQL Procedure&#34;</a>.</p>
<img width="669" height="428" src="img/debugging.gif" alt="Interface for debugging a PL/SQL subprogram"/><br/>
<p>In the code editing window, under the tab with the name of the subprogram, is a toolbar, and beneath it is the text of the subprogram, which you can edit. You can set and unset breakpoints for debugging by clicking to the left of the thin vertical line beside each statement with which you want to associate a breakpoint. (When a breakpoint is set, a red circle is displayed.)</p>
<p>The toolbar under the tab for the subprogram name includes the icons shown in the following figure.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Step Over</span> bypasses the next subprogram (unless the subprogram has a breakpoint) and goes to the next statement after the subprogram. If the execution point is located on a subprogram call, it runs that subprogram without stopping (instead of stepping into it), then positions the execution point on the statement that follows the call. If the execution point is located on the last statement of a subprogram, Step Over returns from the subprogram, placing the execution point on the line of code that follows the call to the subprogram from which you are returning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Step Into</span> executes a single program statement at a time. If the execution point is located on a call to a subprogram, Step Into steps into that subprogram and places the execution point on its first statement. If the execution point is located on the last statement of a subprogram, Step Into returns from the subprogram, placing the execution point on the line of code that follows the call to the subprogram from which you are returning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Step Out</span> leaves the current subprogram and goes to the next statement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Step to End of Method</span> goes to the last statement of the current subprogram.</p>

<p>To debug a function or procedure for a connection where the database is on a different host than the one on which you are running SQL Developer, you can perform remote debugging. Remote debugging involves many of the steps as for local debugging; however, do the following before you start the remote debugging:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Use an Oracle client such as SQL*Plus to issue the debugger connection command. Whatever client you use, make sure that the session which issues the debugger connection commands is the same session which executes your PL/SQL program containing the breakpoints. For example, if the name of the remote system is remote1, use the following SQL*Plus statement to open a TCP/IP connection to that system and the port for the JDWP session:</p>
<pre>EXEC DBMS_DEBUG_JDWP.CONNECT_TCP(&#39;remote1&#39;, &#39;4000&#39;);
</pre>
<p>The first parameter is the IP address or host name of the remote system, and the second parameter is the port number on that remote system on which the debugger is listening.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right-click the connection for the remote database, select <span class="bold">Remote Debug</span>, and complete the information in the <a href="dialogs.htm#BACHGIHJ">Debugger - Attach to JPDA</a> dialog box.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Then, follow the steps that you would for local debugging (for example, see <a href="tut_library.htm#CBACAEJG">Section 4.8, &#34;Debug a PL/SQL Procedure&#34;</a>).</p>

<p>If you have any SQL Trace (.trc) output files, you can display them in SQL Developer as an alternative to using the TKPROF program to format the contents of the trace file. To open a .trc file in SQL Developer and see an attractive, effective display of the information, click <span class="bold">File</span>, then <span class="bold">Open</span>, and specify the file; or drag the file&#39;s name or icon into the SQL Developer window.</p>

<p>For an Oracle Database Release 11.1 or later connection, you can use the PL/SQL hierarchical profiler to identify bottlenecks and performance-tuning opportunities in PL/SQL applications. Profiling consists of the two steps: running the PL/SQL module in profiling mode, and analyzing the reports. In addition, some one-time setup work is required the first time you use profiling in SQL Developer.</p>
<p>To initiate profiling, right-click the name of the function or procedure in the Connections navigator hierarchy and select <span class="bold">Profile</span>, or click the Profile button on the PL/SQL source editor toolbar. After the function or procedure is run in profiling mode, the profiler reports are located at the Execution Profiles tab of the object viewer window. You can review subprogram-level execution summary information, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Number of calls to the subprogram</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Time spent in the subprogram itself (function time or self time)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Time spent in the subprogram itself and in its descendent subprograms (subtree time)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Detailed parent-children information, including all subprograms that a given subprogram called (that is, children of the given subprogram)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information about using the PL/SQL hierarchical profiler, see <a class="olink ADFNS023" href="../ADFNS/adfns_profiler.htm#ADFNS023"><span class="italic">Oracle Database Development Guide</span></a>.</p>

<p>A watch enables you to monitor the changing values of variables or expressions as your program runs. After you enter a watch expression, the Watches window displays the current value of the expression. As your program runs, the value of the watch changes as your program updates the values of the variables in the watch expression.</p>
<p>A watch evaluates an expression according to the current context which is controlled by the selection in the Stack window. If you move to a new context, the expression is reevaluated for the new context. If the execution point moves to a location where any of the variables in the watch expression are undefined, the entire watch expression becomes undefined. If the execution point returns to a location where the watch expression can be evaluated, the Watches window again displays the value of the watch expression.</p>
<p>To open the Watches window, click <span class="bold">View</span>, then <span class="bold">Debugger</span>, then <span class="bold">Watches</span>.</p>
<p>To add a watch, right-click in the Watches window and select <span class="bold">Add Watch</span>. To edit a watch, right-click in the Watches window and select <span class="bold">Edit Watch</span>.</p>

<p>The script runner emulates a limited set of SQL*Plus features. You can often enter SQL and SQL*Plus statements and execute them by clicking the <span class="bold">Run Script</span> icon. The Script Output pane displays the output.</p>
<p><a id="sthref219"></a>The SQL*Plus features available in the script runner include @, @@, CONNECT, EXIT, QUIT, UNDEFINE, WHENEVER, and substitution variables. For example, to run a script named c:\myscripts\mytest.sql, type @c:\myscripts\mytest in the Enter SQL Statement box, and click the drop-down next to the Execute Statement icon and select Run Script.</p>
<p>The following considerations apply to using the SQL Developer script runner:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You cannot use bind variables. (The Execute SQL Statement feature does let you use bind variables of type VARCHAR2, NUMBER, and DATE.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For substitution variables, the syntax &amp;&amp;variable assigns a permanent variable value, and the syntax &amp;variable assigns a temporary (not stored) variable value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For EXIT and QUIT, commit is the default behavior, but you can specify rollback. In either case, the context is reset: for example, WHENEVER command information and substitution variable values are cleared.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DESCRIBE works for most, but not all, object types for which it is supported in SQL*Plus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For SQL*Plus statements that are not supported, a warning message is displayed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SQL*Plus comments are ignored.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For XMLType data, data in the column is displayed as &#34;SYS.XMLDATA&#34; if the database connection uses a JDBC Thin driver, but the expanded XML values are displayed if the connection uses an OCI (thick, Type 2) driver.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have SQL*Plus available on your system, you may want to use it instead of the script runner.</p>

<p>The Execute Explain Plan icon generates the execution plan, which you can see by clicking the Explain Plan tab. The execution plan is the sequence of operations that will be performed to execute the statement. An execution plan shows a row source tree with the hierarchy of operations that make up the statement. For each operation, it shows the ordering of the tables referenced by the statement, access method for each table mentioned in the statement, join method for tables affected by join operations in the statement, and data operations such as filter, sort, or aggregation.</p>
<p>In addition to the row source tree, the plan table displays information about optimization (such as the cost and cardinality of each operation), partitioning (such as the set of accessed partitions), and parallel execution (such as the distribution method of join inputs).

<p>The Autotrace pane displays trace-related information when you execute the SQL statement by clicking the <span class="bold">Autotrace</span> icon. Most of the specific information displayed is determined by the <a href="#CHDEDCJD">SQL Developer Preferences</a> for <a href="#CHDIJCCC">Database: Autotrace/Explain Plan</a>. If you cancel a long-running statement, partial execution statistics are displayed.</p>
<p>This information can help you to identify SQL statements that will benefit from tuning. For example, you may be able to optimize predicate handling by transitively adding predicates, rewriting predicates using Boolean algebra principles, moving predicates around in the execution plan, and so on. For more information about tracing and autotrace, see the chapter about tuning in <a class="olink SQPUG018" href="../SQPUG/ch_eight.htm#SQPUG018"><span class="italic">SQL*Plus User&#39;s Guide and Reference</span></a>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Criteria</span>: An expression with one or more criteria that must be satisfied for a result to be returned. You can specify any WHERE clause (without the WHERE keyword). For example, for <code>employees.SALARY</code>, specifying <code>&gt; 10000</code> limits the results to employees with salaries greater than $10,000.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Or</span>: You can specify one or more OR clauses to be added to the query criteria.

<p>To format a <code>.sql</code> file or all <code>.sql</code> files in a directory or folder, you can use the <code>format</code> batch file (Windows) or shell script (Linux) on the operating system command line. These files are located in the <code>sqldeveloper\sqldeveloper\bin</code> folder or <code>sqldeveloper/sqldeveloper/bin</code> directory under the location where you installed SQL Developer.</p>
<p>Before invoking the <code>format</code> file or script, start the SQL Developer graphical interface, so that the <a href="#CHDCAGJI">Database: SQL Formatter</a> preferences (which are used for the formatting) are loaded and available.</p>
<p><code>format.bat</code> or <code>format.sh</code> has the following syntax:</p>

<p>You can use graphical gauges to display query results in the SQL Worksheet and in user-defined reports. In both cases, you need to specify the name of the value column for the gauge data, and minimum and maximum values on the gauge, and the values to be shown as low and high on the gauge (usually between the minimum and maximum values). In the SQL Worksheet, the required structure for the value to be selected is:</p>
<p>&#39;SQLDEV:GAUGE:&lt;min&gt;:&lt;max&gt;:&lt;low&gt;:&lt;high&gt;:&#39; || &lt;value-column&gt;</p>
<p>For example, to display the last name and the salary in gauge format, where the gauge shows from 1000 to 30000 with below 10000 as low and above 18000 as high, for employees with ID numbers less than a number to be specified, connect to the supplied HR schema and execute the following query:</p>
<pre>SELECT last_name, &#39;SQLDEV:GAUGE:1000:30000:10000:18000:&#39; || salary 
  FROM employees WHERE employee_id &lt; :employee_id
</pre>
<p>If you specify 104 as the bind variable value, the output appears as shown in the following figure:</p>
<img width="409" height="144" src="img/gauge_worksheet.gif" alt="Gauge display of preceding query"/><br/>
<p>For a user-defined gauge report, the query must specify only the value column, the minimum and maximum values, and the low and high values, and optionally a WHERE clause. The required structure for the query (before any optional WHERE clause) is:</p>
<p>SELECT &lt;value-column&gt;, &lt;min&gt;, &lt;max&gt;, &lt;low&gt;, &lt;high&gt; FROM &lt;table-name&gt;</p>
<p>For example, to create a report of salaries in gauge dial format, with the same values and WHERE clause as in the preceding query, right-click on User Defined Reports in the Reports navigator and select <span class="bold">Add Report</span>. In the Add Report dialog box, specify a report name; for <span class="bold">Style</span>, select <span class="bold">Gauge</span>; and for <span class="bold">SQL</span>, enter the following:</p>
<pre>SELECT salary, 1000, 30000, 10000, 18000 FROM employees
  WHERE employee_id &lt; :EMPLOYEE_ID;
</pre>
<p>Click the <span class="bold">Chart Details</span> tab near the bottom of the box; for <span class="bold">Chart Type</span>, select DIAL; for <span class="bold">Query Based</span>, select true; and click <span class="bold">Apply</span>.</p>
<p>Use the Reports navigator to view the newly created user-defined report. For <span class="bold">Connection</span>, specify one that connects to the HR sample schema. For the bind variable value, specify 104. The report shows four semicircular dials, each with a label containing the salary amount and a &#34;needle&#34; pointing to an appropriate place on the dial.</p>

<p>Snippets are code fragments, such as SQL functions, Optimizer hints, and miscellaneous PL/SQL programming techniques. Some snippets are just syntax, and others are examples. You can insert and edit snippets when you are using the SQL Worksheet or creating or editing a PL/SQL function or procedure.</p>
<p>To display snippets, from the <span class="bold">View</span> menu, select <span class="bold">Snippets</span>. In the snippets window (on the right side), use the drop-down to select a group (such as Aggregate Functions or Character Functions). In most cases, the fragments in each group do not represent all available objects in that logical grouping, or all formats and options of each fragment shown. For complete and detailed information, see the Oracle Database documentation.</p>
<p>To insert a snippet into your code in a SQL Worksheet or in a PL/SQL function or procedure, drag the snippet from the snippets window and drop it into the desired place in your code; then edit the syntax so that the SQL function is valid in the current context. To see a brief description of a SQL function in a tooltip, hold the pointer over the function name.</p>
<p>For example, you could type SELECT and then drag CONCAT(char1, char2) from the Character Functions group. Then, edit the CONCAT function syntax and type the rest of the statement, such as in the following:</p>
<pre>SELECT CONCAT(title, &#39; is a book in the library.&#39;) FROM books;

<p>You can create and edit snippets. User-defined snippets are intended mainly to enable you to supplement the Oracle-supplied snippets, although you are also permitted to replace an Oracle-supplied snippet with your own version.</p>
<p>When you create a user-defined snippet, you can add it to one of the Oracle-supplied snippet categories (such as Aggregate Functions) or to a category that you create. If you add a snippet to an Oracle-supplied category and if your snippet has the same name as an existing snippet, your snippet definition replaces the existing one. (If you later upgrade to a new version of SQL Developer and if you choose to preserve your old settings, your old user-defined snippets will replace any Oracle-supplied snippets of the same name in the new version of SQL Developer.)</p>
<p>To create a snippet, do any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Open the Snippets window and click the <span class="bold">Add User Snippets</span> icon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select text for the snippet in the SQL Worksheet window, right-click, and select <span class="bold">Save Snippet</span>.</p>

<h3 class="sect2"><span class="secnum">1.10.1</span> About Subversion and SQL Developer</h3>
<p>Before you can work with a Subversion repository through SQL Developer, you must create a connection to it. When you create a local Subversion repository, a connection to it is automatically created, and this can be seen in the Versioning navigator. You can subsequently edit the connection details.</p>
<p>To connect to an existing Subversion repository (if no connection to that repository exists), use the Versioning navigator, as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If the Versioning navigator is not visible, click <span class="bold">View</span>, then <span class="bold">Team</span>, then <span class="bold">Versioning Navigator</span>.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Use the connection to access the repository.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Existing files must be imported into the Subversion repository to bring them under version control. Files are then checked out from the Subversion repository to a local folder known as the &#34;Subversion working copy&#34;. Files created in (or moved into) SQL Developer must be stored in the Subversion working copy.</p>
<p>Files newly created within SQL Developer must be added to version control. Changed and new files are made available to other users by committing them to the SQL Developer repository. The Subversion working copy can be updated with the contents of the Subversion repository to incorporate changes made by other users.</p>

<p>CVS repositories can be created on a local PC or remote server. There can be more than one CVS repository. You need to create one or more CVS repositories.</p>
<p>Source files are held in a CVS repository. The source files in a CVS repository are grouped into modules. If you have new files, a wizard in SQL Developer will help you import them into the CVS repository and place them under version control. A copy is made of your original files and placed in a subdirectory (.backup) of the one from which you imported them.</p>
<p>Files to be worked on are checked out from the CVS repository. This makes a local copy of the files. You can see the contents of the CVS repository in the SQL Developer CVS Navigator and open read-only versions of files. You can then decide which files you want to check out and work on.</p>
<p>CVS creates a new directory populated with the copy of the source files. You can see the files in the System Navigator. You can also open them from here.</p>
<p>Source files have a status, depending on what operations have been carried out on them. A preference lets you choose whether the version control status of a file is shown in the System Navigator.</p>

<p>SQL Developer enables users with DBA (database administrator) privileges to view (and in some cases edit) certain information relevant to DBAs and, in some cases, to perform DBA operations. To perform DBA operations, use the <span class="bold">DBA navigator</span>, which is similar to the Connections navigator in that it has nodes for all defined database connections. (If the DBA navigator is not visible, select <span class="bold">View</span>, then <span class="bold">DBA</span>.)</p>
<p>If no connections appear in the DBA navigator display, you must add at least one connection. To add a connection to the DBA navigator, click the plus (<span class="bold">+</span>) icon or right-click Connections and select <span class="bold">Add Connection</span>; then select a connection. (You can also specify a new connection by clicking the plus (<span class="bold">+</span>) icon in the <a href="dialogs.htm#BACCEADJ">Select Connection</a> dialog box.)</p>
<p>You should add only connections for which the associated database user has DBA privileges (or at least privileges for the desired DBA navigator operations) on the specified database. If you attempt to perform a DBA navigator operation for which the database connection user does not have sufficient privileges, you will receive an error.</p>
<p>The following options are available from the DBA navigator hierarchy:</p>

</pre>
<p>To perform limited database management operations, you can right-click the connection name in the DBA navigator display and select <span class="bold">Manage Database</span>. For example, if a listener is running with a static listener configured for the database, you can start and stop the database, force database startup, and restrict access to the database.</p>
<p>You can right-click an item (node) at any level in the DBA navigator hierarchy to display a context menu with commands relevant to that item. Typical commands include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Refresh</span> queries the database for the current details about the selected object (for example, a connection or just a table).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Apply Filter</span> restricts the display of objects using a filter that you specify. To remove the effects of applying a filter, right-click the node and select <span class="bold">Clear Filter</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Open</span> displays a pane with relevant information on the right side of the window. The pane may be read-only or editable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Create New</span> enables you to create a new object of that type.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Help</span> displays a brief definition or description of objects of that type.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The pane with information about an item opened from the DBA navigator typically contains icons and other controls for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Freeze View</span> (the <span class="bold">pin</span>) keeps that object&#39;s tab and information in the window when you click another object in the Connections navigator; a separate tab and display are created for that other object. If you click the pin again, the object&#39;s display is available for reuse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Run</span> updates the display by querying the database for the latest information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Refresh</span> lets you select an interval for automatically updating the display.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Actions</span> displays a menu with actions appropriate for the object. The actions are the same as when you right-click an object of that type in the Connections navigator.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With information displays that are in grid form:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can often use the context (right-click) menu on a header or a data cell to perform operations like those for the table data grid, as explained in <a href="#CHDHFJBE">Section 1.5, &#34;Entering and Modifying Data&#34;</a>. For example, right-clicking on a header lets you select options like Auto-fit, Columns, Sort, Delete Persisted Settings (such as any sort order specifications), and Filter Column; right-clicking any data cell lets you select options like Save Grid as Report, Single-Record View, Count Rows, Find/Highlight (find and optionally highlight values in the grid), and Export (unload data).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can click the column heading to display a Filter box to restrict the display to entries containing a string. For example, in the Database Configuration: Current Database Properties page, you can click PROPERTY_NAME and type <code>NLS</code> to see only properties containing &#34;NLS&#34; (that is, globalization properties).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For information that is read-only (not editable) using the DBA navigator, you may have other options within SQL Developer to specify relevant values. For example, to change the value of any globalization support (NLS) parameter, you can use the <a href="#CEGGJJAE">Database: NLS</a> preferences pane to change the value for use with all SQL Developer connections (current and future), or you can use the ALTER SESSION statement in the SQL Worksheet window to change the value for the current connection only.</p>
<p>Detailed explanations of various DBA options, including usage and reference information, are available in appropriate manuals in the <span class="italic">Oracle Database Documentation Library</span> on the Oracle Technology Network (OTN).</p>

<a id="CEGIJBDC"></a>
<div id="RPTUG45302" class="sect3"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" -->
<h4 class="sect3"><span class="secnum">1.11.5.1</span> Using Action Jobs</h4>
<p>Action jobs are applicable to connections to an Oracle Database Release 11.1 or later database.</p>
<p>Most backup and recovery actions involve RMAN scripts. The action jobs dialog boxes let you save the generated RMAN to a disk; you can then copy the script to the server system and run the script there.</p>
<p>Before you can execute the script for an action job, you must create a DBMS_SCHEDULER credential by running a procedure in the following format:</p>
<pre>BEGIN
    DBMS_SCHEDULER.CREATE_CREDENTIAL(
        username =&gt; &#39;<span class="italic">user-name</span>&#39;,
        password =&gt; &#39;<span class="italic">password</span>&#39;,
        database_role =&gt; NULL,
        windows_domain =&gt; NULL,
        comments =&gt; NULL,
        credential_name =&gt; &#39;<span class="italic">credential-name</span>&#39;
    );
END;
/
</pre>
<p>Then, run the Action Jobs, Configure action. This action places some scripts in the server-side database home (in <code><span class="codeinlineitalic">&lt;home&gt;</span></code><code>/sqldeveloper/dbascripts</code>) and creates some DBMS_SCHEDULER program objects in the database. (If you want to unconfigure an action job, you can use the Action Jobs, Unconfigure action, which removes the server-side directory containing the script and log files and drops the DBMS_SCHEDULER program objects.)</p>
<p>After you perform the configuration, the Run Scheduler Job action of the Script Processing control becomes available in the RMAN dialog boxes, and you can click <span class="bold">Apply</span> to cause the RMAN script to be executed in the server using a DBMS_SCHEDULER job.</p>
<p>After an RMAN job has been run, you can view the log file containing the output from RMAN by using the Action Jobs, View Latest Log action. This lets you check for any errors that may have occurred during the running of the RMAN script.</p>
<p>Some RMAN jobs involve performing a database restart. Examples are setting the archive log mode and some whole database backup and restore operations. In such cases, after you click Apply you are asked to confirm that you want to proceed; and if you do proceed, the job is queued (with no waiting for the completion). Because of the restart, the SQL Developer connection must be disconnected and then connected again after the database is restarted. After the reconnection, examine the log file to see whether the job completed successfully.</p>

<p>A temporary tablespace group is a tablespace group that is assigned as the default temporary tablespace for the database. (A tablespace group enables a database user to consume temporary space from multiple tablespaces. Using a tablespace group, rather than a single temporary tablespace, can alleviate problems caused where one tablespace is inadequate to hold the results of a sort, particularly on a table that has many partitions.) The Temporary Tablespace Groups option displays, for each tablespace group, its name, the number of tablespaces in the group, the total size of the tablespaces, and whether the group is the default temporary tablespace.</p>

To use the SQL Developer scheduling features, you must first understand the concepts and essential tasks for job scheduling, which are explained in the chapters about Oracle Scheduler concepts and scheduling jobs in <a class="olink ADMIN" href="../ADMIN/toc.htm"><span class="italic">Oracle Database Administrator&#39;s Guide</span></a>.</p>
<p>The Scheduler node for a connection appears in the Connections navigator and in the DBA navigator. The DBA navigator displays Scheduler objects owned by the SYS user and requiring DBA privileges for creating and modifying; the Connections navigator displays other Scheduler objects that may require specific privileges for creating and modifying. The Oracle Scheduler objects are grouped under object types that include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="#CEGDCAJH">Chains</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="#CEGFDFHF">Credentials</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="#CEGCAJCF">Database Destinations</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="#CEGBIJFJ">Jobs</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="#CEGHIJAF">Job Classes</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="#CEGFGEJJ">Programs</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="#CEGHHEJA">Schedules</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can right-click an item (node) at any level in the Scheduler hierarchy to display a context menu with commands relevant to that item. Typical commands include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">New</span> <span class="bolditalic">[object-type]</span> enables you to create a new object of that type.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Refresh</span> queries the database for the current details about the selected object (for example, a connection or just a table).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Apply Filter</span> restricts the display of objects using a filter that you specify. To remove the effects of applying a filter, right-click the node and select <span class="bold">Clear Filter</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Open</span> displays a pane with relevant information on the right side of the window. The pane may be read-only or editable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Help</span> displays a brief definition or description of objects of that type.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Drop</span> (with an object selected) drops (deletes) the object.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Create Like</span> (with an object selected) creates an object of that type using information from the selected object. You must specify a name for the newly created object, and you can change other properties as needed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you right-click the top-level Scheduler node, you can create an object of a specified type, and you can display the <a href="#BABHCCGE">Scheduler Design Editor</a>.</p>
<p>The pane with information about an item opened from the Scheduler hierarchy typically contains icons and other controls for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Freeze View</span> (the <span class="bold">pin</span>) keeps that object&#39;s tab and information in the window when you click another object in the Connections navigator; a separate tab and display are created for that other object. If you click the pin again, the object&#39;s display is available for reuse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Run</span> updates the display by querying the database for the latest information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Refresh</span> lets you select an interval for automatically updating the display.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Actions</span> displays a menu with actions appropriate for the object. For example, the actions for a job include New Job, Drop, Run Job Now, and Create Like.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With information displays that are in grid form, you can often use the context (right-click) menu on a header or a data cell to perform operations like those for the table data grid, as explained in <a href="#CHDHFJBE">Section 1.5, &#34;Entering and Modifying Data&#34;</a>. For example, right-clicking on a header lets you select options like Auto-fit, Columns, Sort, Delete Persisted Settings (such as any sort order specifications), and Filter Column; right-clicking any data cell lets you select options like Save Grid as Report, Single-Record View, Count Rows, Find/Highlight (find and optionally highlight values in the grid), and Export (unload data).</p>
<p>Several <a href="#CHDCFEBD">Scheduler reports</a> are also available.</p>
<a id="BABHCCGE"></a>
<div id="RPTUG45332" class="sect2"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" -->
<h3 class="sect2"><span class="secnum">1.12.1</span> Scheduler Design Editor</h3>
<p>The scheduler design editor is a graphical interface for <a href="#CEGFEEHI">Scheduling Jobs Using SQL Developer</a>. To create, edit, or delete any Oracle Scheduler objects in the editor, you must be in <span class="bold">write mode</span>. You can use the editor toolbar toggle button or the right-click command to <span class="italic">Switch to write mode</span> and <span class="italic">Switch to read-only mode</span>.</p>
<p>To copy existing objects to the schedule design editor, drag the objects from the Connections navigator onto the editing canvas.</p>
<p>To create a new object, right-click in the canvas and select the context menu command for creating a new object of the desired type.</p>
<p>To open an object, double-click it or right-click it and select <span class="bold">Open</span>.</p>
<p>To delete an object, right-click it and select <span class="bold">Drop</span>. You will be prompted to confirm that you want to drop the object.</p>
<p>To remove the object from the editing canvas without deleting the object itself, right-click it and select <span class="bold">Clear</span>.</p>
<p>To enable a disabled object, right-click it and select <span class="bold">Enable</span>; to disable an enabled object, right-click it and select <span class="bold">Disable</span>.</p>
<p>You can click, drag, and release to <span class="bolditalic">set</span> a relationship between compatible objects. For example, to set a schedule for a job, you can drag the schedule onto the job, which causes a line to be drawn between the objects. You can <span class="bolditalic">unset</span> (remove) that relationship by right-clicking the line and selecting the appropriate command (such as <span class="bold">Unset Schedule</span>), and then clicking <span class="bold">OK</span> when you are prompted to confirm the action.</p>

<p>The Cart is a convenient tool for deploying Oracle Database objects from one or more database connections to a destination connection. You drag and drop objects from the Connections navigator into the Cart window (or you can open a previously saved cart XML file), specify any desired options, and click the Deploy icon to display the <a href="dialogs.htm#BABBAJHC">Deploy Objects</a> dialog box. After you complete the information in that dialog box, SQL Developer creates a .zip file containing scripts (including a master script) that can be used to create the objects in the schema of a desired destination connection.</p>
<p>Before you use the Cart, ensure that the <a href="#CEGFDHCD">Database: Utilities: Cart</a> and <a href="#CEGCIHHF">Database: Utilities: Cart: Cart Deploy</a> preferences reflect what you want.</p>
<p>To display the Cart window, click <span class="bold">View</span>, then <span class="bold">Cart</span>. The following figure shows that window after some objects have been added.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>If you want to be able to repeat the operation (with or without slight modifications), the Cart provides a convenient way to save a cart and to deploy it, and then run the scripts in multiple destinations (schemas in the same database or another database). You can also open a saved cart, modify it as needed, save it to a different cart name, and deploy that cart.</p>

<p>SQL Developer lets you work with Oracle Spatial data and metadata. Oracle Spatial (referred to as Spatial) facilitates the storage, retrieval, update, and query of collections of spatial features in an Oracle database. Spatial includes a schema (MDSYS), a data type (SDO_GEOMETRY), a spatial indexing mechanism and index type, and operators, functions, and procedures for performing area-of-interest queries, spatial join queries, and other spatial analysis operations.</p>
<p>For complete information about Oracle Spatial, including the differences between Spatial and Oracle Locator (a subset of Spatial), see <a class="olink SPATL" href="../SPATL/toc.htm"><span class="italic">Oracle Spatial Developer&#39;s Guide</span></a>.</p>

<p>A <span class="bold">change plan</span> is an Oracle Change Manager container for schema object changes. Using SQL Developer, you can create change plans and populate them change information. Later, a database administrator deploys the change plan to one or more destination databases using Oracle Enterprise Manager.</p>
<p>A change plan can contain multiple <span class="bold">change items</span>, each of which describes changes to be made to a single schema object. There are three types of change item, reflecting three basic actions to be carried out at the destination database:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An <span class="bold">Add change item</span> adds a database object.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <span class="bold">Drop change item</span> drops the database object. (The definition of the object to be dropped is copied into the change item, enabling Change Manager to check the definition in the destination database to ensure that the object definitions are the same.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <span class="bold">Modify change item</span> makes one or more changes to a database object (for example, adding a column or a constraint to a table).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To deploy a change plan to a destination database, the DBA uses Enterprise Manager to create a Change Manager Schema Synchronization from the contents of the change plan. During this process, Change Manager detects and reports conflicts between the change plan and the database. (For example, the database may already contain an object that the change plan is trying to add.) The generated script carries out operations in the correct order.</p>
<p>The <a href="#CEGIHBHI">Change Management Parameters</a> user preferences affect Change Manager support in SQL Developer, especially how objects are compared to determine if a change has occurred and how extensive the DDL statements are when the script for deploying changes is generated.</p>

<p>Change plans are stored in the Enterprise Manager repository. An Enterprise Manager super administrator has unlimited access to all change plans. However, in most cases, it is preferable to create Enterprise Manager administrators with specific Change Plan privileges and limited access to other Enterprise Manager facilities. There are two general types of Change Plan privilege:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A <span class="bold">Change Plan Administrator</span> has unlimited access to change plans: the administrator can create, edit, and delete any change plan. A Change Plan Administrator is typically a DBA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <span class="bold">Change Plan Developer</span> has access to specific change plans. The access may be view-only, or view and edit. A Change Plan Developer is typically a developer of database applications.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To create a Change Plan Administrator or one or more Change Plan Developers, you muse Enterprise Manager, as explained in <a href="#CEGBGCIF">Section 1.15.3, &#34;Change Manager Actions to Perform with Enterprise Manager&#34;</a>.</p>

Create the database connection specifying the user name and password of a suitably privileged user, and the connection details for the schema Enterprise Manager repository.</p>

<h4 class="sect3"><span class="secnum">1.15.2.4</span> Using Change Plans to Capture Change in SQL Developer</h4>
<p>There are two basic approaches to capturing changes in change plans: single database or multiple databases. The approach chosen may depend on the complexity of the work and the number of developers involved.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Single database</span>: Before development starts, the developer creates Monitor change items for all objects that might be modified or dropped. The developer then begins development work in the database -- adding, modifying, and dropping objects. As this work progresses, the developer updates Monitor change items to make them into Modify change items, or converts them to Drop change items, and creates new Add change items. At the end of development work, the change plan contains the changes that took place during the development cycle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Multiple databases</span>: One database represents the pre-development state and is not modified during development work. All work takes place in one or more development databases. Monitor and Drop change items are created as needed from the pre-development database, and then updated from the development database(s). Changes from multiple developers working in multiple databases can be combined into a single change plan.</p>
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>
<p>Creating change plans from Change Manager schema comparisons</p>

<h4 class="sect3"><span class="secnum">1.15.3.1</span> Creating Change Plans from Change Manager Schema Comparisons</h4>
<p>You can create change plans in Enterprise Manager and populate them from Change Manager schema comparisons. On the Databases page, select <span class="bold">Schema Change Plans</span>, then <span class="bold">Create</span>. Enter the name of the new change plan and click <span class="bold">OK</span>. In the resulting Change Plan page, click <span class="bold">Create from Comparison</span>. Select a version of a Schema Comparison, and a Conversion Assignment as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For the Change From side, select the side of the comparison that represents the original state of the schema objects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the Change To side, select the side of the comparison that represents the developed (or evolved) state of the schema objects.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on your selection, Change Manager populates the change clan with Add, Drop, and Modify change items that, if applied to the Change From objects, will convert them into the Change To objects.</p>
</div>
<!-- class="sect3" -->
<div id="RPTUG45350" class="sect3"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref254"></a>
<h4 class="sect3"><span class="secnum">1.15.3.2</span> Deploying Change Plans</h4>
<p>To deploy change plans, Change Manager uses the script generation capability contained in its Schema Synchronizations application. You deploy a change plan by creating a synchronization that applies the changes in the change plan to a database that you select. To reduce the chance of incompatible change conflicts, the objects in the database should be identical or similar to the initial objects from which the change plan&#39;s change items were created.</p>
<p>To deploy a change clan to a database, select the plan on the Change Plans page, and then click <span class="bold">Create Synchronization from Change Plan</span>. This takes you to the first page of the Create Schema Synchronization wizard. The process of creating a synchronization from a Change Plan is similar to creating a synchronization from scratch. However, in the first phase of synchronization processing, rather than comparing the source database (or baseline version) to the destination database, Change Manager applies the changes contained in the change plan to the destination database definitions (not to the actual objects). The result of this operation provides the basis for script generation and execution, the second and third phases of schema synchronization processing.</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="RPTUG45351"></a>Conflicts</p>
<p>During change plan processing, Change Manager may detect conflicts between change items and the destination database. In general, a conflict means that the state of the destination database is not what was expected. Examples of conflicts include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A table that is to be added already exists, and has a different definition than that contained in the change item.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A table to be modified does not exist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A column to be added to a table already exists and has a different data type than the column added by the change item.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A constraint to be dropped from a table does not exist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A view to be dropped exists, but has a different definition than that stored in the change item.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A procedure to be dropped does not exist.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After changes have been applied to the destination definitions, Change Manager reports the results of the operations, including any conflicts encountered.</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="RPTUG45352"></a>Change Plans and Schema Synchronizations: Comparison</p>
<p>Schema change plans and schema synchronizations are similar in some ways, and use some of the same underlying technology. However, they have different purposes and uses:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The purpose of a <span class="italic">schema synchronization</span> is to make the set of objects at the destination database identical to those at the source database or baseline version. Schema synchronization compares the objects at the source and destination, and then generates a script to reconcile all the differences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The purpose of a <span class="italic">change plan</span> is to carry out a specific set of changes at any destination database. The changes may apply to an entire object (Add or Drop), or to attributes of an object (Modify, for example, add a column).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, schema synchronization picks up any changes that have been made to the destination object or schema and makes those changes at the destination. Change plan deployment, however, makes only those changes specified in the change items.</p>
<p>With schema synchronizations, there is no chance of conflict because the source definition always overrides the destination definition. With change plans, however, there is a possibility of conflict, because the specified changes might not be applicable at a destination database or might conflict with other changes.</p>

<h3 class="sect2"><span class="secnum">1.16.1</span> About Oracle Application Express Listener</h3>
<p>Oracle Application Express Listener is a JEE-based alternative for Oracle HTTP Server (OHS) and mod_plsql. The JEE implementation offers increased functionality including command line based configuration, enhanced security, file caching and RESTful Web Services. Oracle Application Express Listener also provides increased flexibility by supporting deployments using Oracle WebLogic Server, Oracle Glassfish Server, and a standalone mode.</p>
<p>The Oracle Application Express architecture requires some form of Web server to proxy requests between a Web browser and the Oracle Application Express engine. Oracle Application Express Listener satisfies this need but its use goes beyond that of Oracle Application Express configurations. Using Oracle Application Express Listener simplifies the deployment process because there is no Oracle home required as connectivity is provided using an embedded JDBC driver. See <a class="olink AELIG" href="http://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=E50529-01&amp;id=AELIG"><span class="italic">Oracle Application Express Listener Installation and Developer Guide</span></a> for concepts and details.</p>
<p>The Oracle Application Express Listener (Release 2.0 or later) must be installed and running in order to retrieve or upload administration settings. In addition, the Application Express Listener Administrator user must be configured on the Application Express Listener. See Oracle Application Express Listener Installation and Developer Guide for information about installing Oracle Application Express Listener.</p>

<h4 class="sect3"><span class="secnum">1.16.4.3</span> Security</h4>
<p>Security settings are used to validate procedure requests and determine if a user is allowed to access the procedure.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Verify Secure Socket Layer Requests</span>: Enable this option if HTTPS is available in your environment.</p>
<p>A RESTful service can be protected with the OAuth2 protocol to control access to non-public data. OAuth2 requires all requests involved in the OAuth2 authentication process to be transported via HTTPS. The default behavior of the Application Express Listener is to verify that all OAuth2 related requests have been received via HTTPS. It will refuse to service any such requests received over HTTP, returning an HTTP status code of 403 Forbidden.</p>
<p>Disabling this option should only be used for development or test environments. Do not disable this option for production environments because it will result in user credentials being passed in clear text.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Security Cache</span>: When you specify a PL/SQL validation function, Oracle Application Express Listener uses the security cache to cache the procedures names and determine if they are valid or invalid. Using a caching mechanism reduces the number of database round-trips needed to execute the PL/SQL <a href="#CEGBGAJI">Validation Function</a>.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Maximum Cache Entries</span>: Maximum cache size. When the maximum entries have been reached, the older (or stale) procedure name that was least recently used is removed from the cache and a new procedure name is added to the cache.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Total Cache Entries</span>: Total number of procedure names that are valid or invalid in the security cache.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Clear Cache</span>: If the total cache entries is greater than zero, Clear Cache is available, and you can click it to delete the cache entries. As a best practice, clear the cache whenever a PL/SQL Validation Function is updated.</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="CEGCEEJD"></a><a id="RPTUG45964"></a>Allowed Procedures</p>
<p>Specify patterns for procedures, packages, or schema names that are allowed to be directly executed from a browser. You can use an asterisk (*) to substitute zero or more characters, and a question mark (?) to substitute for any one character.</p>
<p>A benefit of specifying allowed procedures is that the procedure names and procedure patterns are stored in the Oracle Application Express Listener. By contrast, invoking the PL/SQL validation function requires a database round-trip.</p>
<p>To add an entry, click the Add Procedure (+) icon and enter the pattern. To delete an entry, select it and click the Remove Procedure (X) icon.</p>
<p>If no allowed procedures are specified, the Oracle Application Express Listener does not validate the procedure names to determine if the procedure is allowed for processing.</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="CEGGFBAG"></a><a id="RPTUG45965"></a>Blocked Procedures</p>
<p>Specify patterns for procedures, packages, or schema names that are forbidden be directly executed from a browser. You can use an asterisk (*) to substitute zero or more characters, and a question mark (?) to substitute for any one character.</p>
<p>If no blocked procedures are specified, the Oracle Application Express Listener does not validate the procedure names to determine if the procedure is blocked from processing</p>
<p>To add an entry, click the Add Procedure (+) icon and enter the pattern. To delete an entry, select it and click the Remove Procedure (X) icon.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Disable Default Internal Exclusion List</span>: If option is selected, the Oracle Application Express Listener internal exclusion list is not enforced. This internal exclusion list blocks users from accessing the following:</p>
<pre>sys.*, dbms_*, utl_*, owa_*, owa.*, htp.*, htf.*, wpg_docload.*
</pre>
<p>Oracle recommends that you <span class="bolditalic">not</span> select this option; that is, do not disable the default internal exclusion list. The only possible exception is temporarily disabling the internal exclusion list for debugging purposes.</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="CEGBGAJI"></a><a id="RPTUG45966"></a>Validation Function</p>
<p>You can use the Validation Function to determine if the requested procedure in the URL should be allowed for processing. Oracle Application Express Listener executes the validation function you specify for each requested procedure, or checks the security cache to determine if a procedure is valid or invalid.</p>
<p>The validation function returns <code>true</code> if the procedure is allowed for processing. Otherwise, it returns <code>false</code>.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Validation Function Type</span>: Implementation language: PL/SQL or JavaScript.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Validation Function</span>: For PL/SQL, the name of the stored function that resides in the database. If the validation function you specify does not exist, an error message is displayed.</p>
<p>For JavaScript, the code written in JavaScript. The advantage of using JavaScript instead of using the PL/SQL database function is that there are not any database round-trips to execute the validation function.</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="CEGCJCIF"></a><a id="RPTUG45967"></a>Virus Scanning</p>
<p>Specify the Internet Content Adaptation Protocol (ICAP) Server name and Port for virus-scanning of your files. A message is displayed if a file is infected.</p>

This may help with problem diagnosis and is appended to the Application Express Listener log output. However, you should <span class="italic">not</span> enable this option on production systems due to the performance impact of outputting large amounts of data to the log.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Show error messages on browser</span>: If selected, displays error responses in the browser, including for each a detailed error message and a stack trace.

<p>SQL Developer provides many reports about the database and its objects. You can also create your own user-defined reports. To display reports, click the Reports tab on the left side of the window (see <a href="#BHAHIFGB">SQL Developer User Interface</a>). If this tab is not visible, select <span class="bold">View</span> and then <span class="bold">Reports</span>.</p>
<p>Individual reports are displayed in tabbed panes on the right side of the window; and for each report, you can select (in a drop-down control) the database connection for which to display the report. For reports about objects, the objects shown are only those visible to the database user associated with the selected database connection, and the rows are usually ordered by Owner. The detail display pane for a report includes the following icons at the top:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Freeze View</span> <a id="sthref257"></a><a id="sthref258"></a>(the <span class="bold">pin</span>) keeps that report in the SQL Developer window when you click another report in the Reports navigator; a separate tab and detail view pane are created for that other report. If you click the pin again, the report&#39;s detail view pane is available for reuse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Run Report</span> updates the detail view pane display by querying the database for the latest information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Run Report in SQL Worksheet</span> displays the SQL statement used to retrieve the information for a report in a SQL Worksheet pane, where you can view, edit, and run the statement (see <a href="#CHDDHAAI">Section 1.7, &#34;Using the SQL Worksheet&#34;</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The time required to display specific reports will vary, and may be affected by the number and complexity of objects involved, and by the speed of the network connection to the database.</p>
<p>For most reports that contain names of database objects, you can double-click the object name in the report display pane (or right-click the object name and select Go To) to display that object in a detail view pane, just as if you had selected that object using the Connections navigator.</p>
<p><a id="sthref259"></a><a id="sthref260"></a><a id="sthref261"></a><a id="sthref262"></a>To export a report into an XML file that can be imported later, right-click the report name in the Reports navigator display and select <span class="bold">Export</span>. To import a report that had previously been exported, select the name of the report folder name (such as a user-defined folder) in which to store the imported report, right-click, and select <span class="bold">Import</span>.</p>
<p><a id="sthref263"></a><a id="sthref264"></a>You can create a <span class="bold">shared report</span> from an exported report by clicking Tools, then Preferences, and using the <a href="#CHDIHFJA">Database: User Defined Extensions</a> pane to add a row with Type as REPORT and Location specifying the exported XML file. The next time you restart SQL Developer, the Reports navigator will have a Shared Reports folder containing that report.</p>

If database developers use the COMMENT statement when creating or modifying tables, this report can provide useful information about the purposes of tables and columns</p>
<p><span class="bold">Constraints</span>: Includes the following reports related to constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">All</span> <span class="bold">Constraints</span>: For each table, lists each associated constraint, including its type (unique constraint, check constraint, primary key, foreign key) and status (enabled or disabled).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Check Constraints</span>: For each check constraint, lists information that includes the owner, the table name, the constraint name, the constraint status (enabled or disabled), and the constraint specification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a id="sthref272"></a><a id="sthref273"></a><span class="bold">Enabled Constraints</span> and <span class="bold">Disabled Constraints</span>: For each constraint with a status of enabled or disabled, lists the table name, constraint name, constraint type (unique constraint, check constraint, primary key, foreign key), and status. A disabled constraint is not enforced when rows are added or modified; to have a disabled constraint enforced, you must edit the table and set the status of the constraint to Enabled (see the appropriate tabs for the <a href="dialogs.htm#BACGJDDB">Create/Edit Table (with advanced options)</a> dialog box).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Foreign Key Constraints</span>: For each foreign key constraint, lists information that includes the owner, the table name, the constraint name, the column that the constraint is against, the table that the constraint references, and the constraint in the table that is referenced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Primary Key Constraints</span>: For primary key constraint, lists information that includes the owner, the table name, the constraint name, the constraint status (enabled or disabled), and the column name.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p><span class="bold">Quality Assurance</span>: (See <a href="#CHDDBJIB">Quality Assurance reports</a>.)</p>
<p><span class="bold">Statistics</span>: For each table, lists statistical information, including when it was last analyzed, the total number of rows, the average row length, and the table type. In addition, specialized reports order the results by most rows and largest average row length.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Storage</span>: Lists information about the table count by tablespace and the tables in each tablespace.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Triggers</span>: Lists information about all triggers, disabled triggers, and enabled triggers.</p>
<p><span class="bold">User Synonyms</span>: Displays information about either all user synonyms or those user synonyms containing the string that you specify in the Enter Bind Variables dialog box (uncheck Null in that box to enter a string).</p>
<p><span class="bold">User Tables</span>: Displays information about either all tables or those tables containing the string that you specify in the Enter Bind Variables dialog box (uncheck Null in that box to enter a string).</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="CHDDBJIB"></a><a id="RPTUG41400"></a>Quality Assurance reports</p>
<p>Quality assurance reports are table reports that identify conditions that are not technically errors, but that usually indicate flaws in the database design. These flaws can result in various problems, such as logic errors and the need for additional application coding to work around the errors, as well as poor performance with queries at runtime.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Tables without Primary Keys</span>: Lists tables that do not have a primary key defined. A primary key is a column (or set of columns) that uniquely identifies each row in the table. Although tables are not required to have a primary key, it is strongly recommended that you create or designate a primary key for each table. Primary key columns are indexed, which enhances performance with queries, and they are required to be unique and not null, providing some &#34;automatic&#34; validation of input data. Primary keys can also be used with foreign keys to provide referential integrity.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Tables without Indexes</span>: Lists tables that do not have any indexes. If a column in a table has an index defined on it, queries that use the column are usually much faster and more efficient than if there is no index on the column, especially if there are many rows in the table and many different data values in the column.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Tables with Unindexed Foreign Keys</span>: Lists any foreign keys that do not have an associated index. A foreign key is a column (or set of columns) that references a primary key: that is, each value in the foreign key must match a value in its associated primary key. Foreign key columns are often joined in queries, and an index usually improves performance significantly for queries that use a column. If an unindexed foreign key is used in queries, you may be able to improve runtime performance by creating an index on that foreign key.</p>

<h3 class="sect2"><span class="secnum">1.18.4</span> Compare and Merge</h3>
<p>The Compare and Merge pane defines options for comparing and merging two source files. For more information, see <a href="#CHDBHDCC">Comparing Source Files</a>.</p>
<p>For each type of option, you can specify a <span class="bold">Maximum File Size (KB)</span>: the maximum size of the file (number of kilobytes) for which the operation will be performed.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Ignore Whitespace</span>: If this option is enabled, leading and trailing tabs and letter spacing are ignored when comparing files. Carriage returns are not ignored. Enabling this option makes comparing two files easier when you have replaced all the space with hard tabs, or vice versa. Otherwise, every line in the two documents might be shown as different in the Compare window.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Show Character Differences</span>: If this option is enabled, characters that are present in one file and not in another are highlighted. Red highlighting indicates a character that has been removed. Green highlighting indicates a character that has been added. The highlighting is shown only when you click into a comparison block that contains character differences.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Enable Java Compare</span>: If this option is enabled, Java source files can be compared in a structured format.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Enable XML Compare</span>: If this option is enabled, XML files can be compared.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Enable XML Merge</span>: If this option is enabled, XML files can be merged.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Reformat Result</span>: If this option is enabled, merged XML files can be reformatted.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Validate Result (May require Internet access)</span>: If this option is enabled, merged XML files will be validated.</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="CHDBHDCC"></a><a id="RPTUG41430"></a>Comparing Source Files</p>
<p>You can compare source files in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A file currently being edited with its saved version: Place the focus on the current version open in the editor; from the main menu, select <span class="bold">File</span>, then <span class="bold">Compare With</span>, then <span class="bold">File on Disk</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One file with another file: Place the focus on the file in the editor to be compared; from the main menu, select <span class="bold">File</span>, then <span class="bold">Compare With</span>, then <span class="bold">Other File</span>.

<p>The Database pane sets properties for the database connection.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Validate date and time default values</span>: If this option is checked, date and time validation is used when you open tables.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Default path to store export in</span>: Default path of the directory or folder under which to store output files when you perform an export operation. To see the current default for your system, click the <span class="bold">Browse</span> button next to this field.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Filename for connection startup script</span>: File name for the startup script to run when an Oracle database connection is opened. You can click <span class="bold">Browse</span> to specify the location. The default location is the default path for scripts (see the <a href="#CHDEDGCI">Database: Worksheet</a> preferences pane).</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="CHDFGCAC"></a><a id="RPTUG41433"></a>Database: Advanced</p>
<p>The Advanced pane specifies options such as the SQL array fetch size and display options for null values.</p>
<p><a id="sthref301"></a><a id="sthref302"></a>You can also specify Kerberos thin driver configuration parameters, which enables you to create database connections using Kerberos authentication and specifying the user name and password. For more information, see the Kerberos Authentication explanation on the <a href="dialogs.htm#BACEDDJF">Oracle tab</a> in the <a href="dialogs.htm#BACICJAF">Create/Edit/Select Database Connection</a> dialog box. For information about configuring Kerberos authentication, see <a class="olink ASOAG060" href="http://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=E50529-01&amp;id=ASOAG060"><span class="italic">Oracle Database Advanced Security Administrator&#39;s Guide</span></a>.</p>
<p><a id="sthref303"></a><a id="sthref304"></a><span class="bold">Use OCI/Thick driver</span>: If this option is checked, and if an OCI (thick, Type 2) driver is available, that driver will be used instead of a JDBC (thin) driver for basic and TNS (network alias) database connections. If any connections use a supported Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) server, check this option.</p>
<p><a id="sthref305"></a><span class="bold">Autocommit</span>: If this option is checked, a commit operation is automatically performed after each INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement executed using the SQL Worksheet. If this option is not checked, a commit operation is not performed until you execute a COMMIT statement.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Kerberos Thin Config: Config File</span>: Kerberos configuration file (for example, krb5.conf). If this is not specified, default locations will be tried for your Java and system configuration.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Kerberos Thin Config: Credential Cache File</span>: Kerberos credential cache file (for example, krb5_cc_cache). If this is not specified, a cache will not be used, and a principal name and password will be required each time.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Tnsnames Directory</span>: Enter or browse to select the location of the tnsnames.ora file. If no location is specified, SQL Developer looks for this file as explained in <a href="#CHDHIFGJ">Section 1.4, &#34;Database Connections&#34;</a>. Thus, any value you specify here overrides any TNS_ADMIN environment variable or registry value or (on Linux systems) the global configuration directory.</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="CHDIJCCC"></a><a id="RPTUG41434"></a><a id="sthref306"></a>Database: Autotrace/Explain Plan</p>
<p>The Autotrace/Explain Plan pane specifies information to be displayed on the Autotrace and Explain Plan panes in the SQL Worksheet.</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="RPTUG45003"></a><a id="sthref307"></a>Database: Drag and Drop</p>
<p>The Drag and Drop Effects pane determines the type of SQL statement created in the SQL Worksheet when you drag an object from the Connections navigator into the SQL Worksheet. The SQL Developer preference sets the default, which you can override in the Drag and Drop Effects dialog box.</p>
<p>The type of statement (INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE, or SELECT) applies only for object types for which such a statement is possible. For example, SELECT makes sense for a table, but not for a trigger. For objects for which the statement type does not apply, the object name is inserted in the SQL Worksheet.</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="CEGGDEDB"></a><a id="RPTUG45368"></a>Database: Licensing</p>
<p>Some SQL Developer features require that licenses for specific Oracle Database options be in effect for the database connection that will use the feature. The Licensing pane enables you to specify, for each defined connection, whether the database has the Oracle Change Management Pack, the Oracle Tuning Pack, and the Oracle Diagnostics Pack.</p>
<p>For each cell in this display (combination of license and connection), the value can be true (checked box), false (cleared box), or unspecified (solid-filled box).</p>
<p>If an option is specified as true for a connection in this pane, you will not be prompted with a message about the option being required when you use that connection for a feature that requires the option.</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="CEGGJJAE"></a><a id="RPTUG41436"></a>Database: NLS</p>
<p>The NLS pane specifies values for globalization support parameters, such as the language, territory, sort preference, and date format. These parameter values are used for SQL Developer session operations, such as for statements executed using the SQL Worksheet and for the National Language Support Parameters report. Specifying values in this preferences pane does <span class="italic">not</span> apply those values to the underlying database itself. To change the database settings, you must change the appropriate initialization parameters and restart the database.</p>
<p>Note that SQL Developer does not use default values from the current system for globalization support parameters; instead, SQL Developer, when initially installed, by default uses parameter values that include the following:</p>
<pre>NLS_LANG,&#34;AMERICAN&#34;
NLS_TERR,&#34;AMERICA&#34;
NLS_CHAR,&#34;AL32UTF8&#34;
NLS_SORT,&#34;BINARY&#34;

<p class="subhead2"><a id="RPTUG41437"></a>Database: ObjectViewer Parameters</p>
<p>The ObjectViewer Parameters pane specifies whether to freeze object viewer windows, and display options for the output. The display options will affect the generated DDL on the SQL tab. The Data Editor Options affect the behavior when you are using the Data tab to edit table data.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Data Editor Options</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Post Edits on Row Change</span>: If this option is checked, posts DML changes when you perform edits using the Data tab (and the Set Auto Commit On option determines whether or not the changes are automatically committed). If this option is not checked, changes are posted and committed when you press the Commit toolbar button.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Set Auto Commit On</span> (available only if Post Edit on Row Changes is enabled): If this option is checked, DML changes are automatically posted and committed when you perform edits using the Data tab.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Clear persisted table column widths, order, sort, and filter settings</span>: If you click <span class="bold">Clear</span>, then any customizations in the Data tab display for table column widths, order, sort, and filtering are not saved for subsequent openings of the tab, but instead the default settings are used for subsequent openings.</p>
<p><span class="bold"><a id="sthref308"></a>Use ORA_ROWSCN for DataEditor insert and update statements</span>: If this option is checked, SQL Developer internally uses the ORA_ROWSCN pseudocolumn in performing insert and update operations when you use the Data tab. If you experience any errors trying to update data, try <span class="italic">unchecking</span> (disabling) this option.</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="RPTUG41438"></a>Database: PL/SQL Compiler</p>
<p>The PL/SQL Compiler pane specifies options for compilation of PL/SQL subprograms.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Generate PL/SQL Debug Information</span>: If this option is checked, PL/SQL debug information is included in the compiled code; if this option is not checked, this debug information is not included. The ability to stop on individual code lines and debugger access to variables are allowed only in code compiled with debug information generated.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Types of messages</span>: You can control the display of informational, severe, and performance-related messages. (The ALL type overrides any individual specifications for the other types of messages.) For each type of message, you can specify any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>No entry (<span class="bold">blank</span>): Use any value specified for ALL; and if none is specified, use the Oracle default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Enable</span>: Enable the display of all messages of this category.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Disable</span>: Disable the display of all messages of this category.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Error</span>: Enable the display of only error messages of this category.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bold">Optimization Level</span>: 0, 1, or 2, reflecting the optimization level that will be used to compile PL/SQL library units. The higher the setting of this parameter, the more effort the compiler makes to optimize PL/SQL library units. However, for a module to be compiled with PL/SQL debugging information, the level must be 0 or 1.</p>
<p><span class="bold">PLScope Identifiers</span>: Specifies the amount of PL/Scope identifier data to collect and use (All or None).</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="RPTUG41439"></a>Database: Reports</p>
<p>The Reports pane specifies options relating to <a href="#CHDBJIBJ">SQL Developer Reports</a>.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Close all reports on disconnect</span>: If this option is checked, all reports for any database connection are automatically closed when that connection is disconnected.</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="RPTUG41440"></a>Database: SQL Editor Code Templates</p>
<p>The SQL Editor Code Templates pane enables you to view, add, and remove templates for editing SQL and PL/SQL code. Code templates assist you in writing code more quickly and efficiently by inserting text for commonly used statements. You can then modify the inserted text.</p>
<p>The template ID string is not used by SQL Developer; only the template content (Description text) is used, in that it is considered by completion insight (explained in <a href="#CEGFEBGC">Code Editor: Completion Insight</a>) in determining whether a completion popup should be displayed and what the popup should contain. For example, if you define code template ID <span class="italic">mydate</span> as <span class="italic">SELECT sysdate FROM dual</span>, then if you start typing <code>select</code> in the SQL Worksheet, the auto-popup includes <span class="italic">SELECT sysdate FROM dual</span>.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Add Template</span>: Adds an empty row in the code template display. Enter an ID value, then move to the Template cell; you can enter template content in that cell, or click the pencil icon to open an editing box to enter the template content.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Remove Template</span>: Deletes the selected code template.</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="CHDCAGJI"></a><a id="RPTUG41441"></a>Database: SQL Formatter</p>
<p>The SQL Formatter pane controls how statements in the SQL Worksheet are formatted when you click Format SQL. The options include whether to insert space characters or tab characters when you press the Tab key (and how many characters), uppercase or lowercase for keywords and identifiers, whether to preserve or eliminate empty lines, and whether comparable items should be placed or the same line (if there is room) or on separate lines.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Import</span>: Lets you import code style profile settings that you previously exported.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Export</span>: Exports the current code profile settings to an XML file.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Autoformat PL/SQL in Procedures, Packages, Views, and Triggers</span>: If this option is checked, the SQL Formatter options are applied automatically as you enter and modify PL/SQL code in procedures, packages, views, and triggers; if this option is not checked, the SQL Formatter options are applied only when you so request.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Panes for product-specific formatting options</span>: Individual panes let you specify formatting options for Oracle and for other vendors (Microsoft Access, IBM DB2, Microsoft SQL Server, Sybase Adaptive Server). In each of these panes, you can click <span class="bold">Edit</span> to specify input/output, alignment, indentation, line breaks, CASE line breaks, white space, and other options.</p>

<p>The Third Party JDBC Drivers pane specifies drivers to be used for connections to third-party (non-Oracle) databases, such as IBM DB2, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, or Sybase Adaptive Server. (You do not need to add a driver for connections to Microsoft Access databases.) To add a driver, click <span class="bold">Add Entry</span> and select the path for the driver:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For IBM DB2: the <code>db2jcc.jar</code> and <code>db2jcc_license_cu.jar</code> files, which are available from IBM</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For MySQL: a file with a name similar to <code>mysql-connector-java-5.0.4-bin.jar</code>, in a directory under the one into which you unzipped the download for the MySQL driver</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For Microsoft SQL Server or Sybase Adaptive Server: <code>jtds-1.2.jar</code>, which is included in the <code>jtds-1.2-dist.zip</code> download</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For Teradata: <code>tdgssconfig.jar</code> and <code>terajdbc4.jar</code>, which are included (along with a <code>readme.txt</code> file) in the <code>TeraJDBC__indep_indep.12.00.00.110.zip</code> or <code>TeraJDBC__indep_indep.12.00.00.110.tar</code> download</p>

As an alternative to using this preference, you can click <span class="bold">Help</span>, then <span class="bold">Check for Updates</span> to install the JTDS JDBC Driver for Microsoft SQL Server and the MySQL JDBE Driver as extensions.</div>
<p>To find a specific third-party JDBC driver, see the appropriate website (for example, <code><a href="http://www.mysql.com">http://www.mysql.com</a></code> for the MySQL Connector/J JDBC driver for MySQL, <code><a href="http://jtds.sourceforge.net/">http://jtds.sourceforge.net/</a></code> for the jTDS driver for Microsoft SQL Server and Sybase Adaptive Server, or search at <code><a href="http://www.teradata.com/">http://www.teradata.com/</a></code> for the JDBC driver for Teradata). For MySQL, use the MySQL 5.0 driver, not 5.1 or later, with SQL Developer release 1.5.</p>
<p>You must specify a third-party JDBC driver or install a driver using the Check for Updates feature before you can create a database connection to a third-party database of that associated type. (See the tabs for creating connections to third-party databases in the <a href="dialogs.htm#BACICJAF">Create/Edit/Select Database Connection</a> dialog box.)</p>

<p>The User Defined Extensions pane specifies user-defined extensions that have been added. You can use this pane to add extensions that are not available through the Check for Updates feature. These extensions can be for user-defined reports, actions, editors, and navigators. (For more information about extensions and checking for updates, see <a href="#CHDBBBID">Section 1.18.7, &#34;Extensions&#34;</a>.)</p>
<p>One use of the Database: User-Defined Extensions pane is to create a Shared Reports folder and to include an exported report under that folder: click Add Row, specify Type as REPORT, and for Location specify the XML file containing the exported report. The next time you restart SQL Developer, the Reports navigator will have a Shared Reports folder containing that report.</p>

<p class="subhead2"><a id="CEGFDHCD"></a><a id="RPTUG45945"></a>Database: Utilities: Cart</p>
<p>The Cart pane specifies the default locations for saving and opening Cart .xml files (<span class="bold">Default Cart Directory</span>) and for specifying .sql script files (<span class="bold">Open Script Directory</span>) to be executed before and after the generated master deployment script (see <a href="#CEGIGDAA">Section 1.13, &#34;Deploying Objects Using the Cart&#34;</a>).</p>

<p>The Cart: Deploy pane specifies options that affect the behavior of the Cart for a deployment (see <a href="#CEGIGDAA">Section 1.13, &#34;Deploying Objects Using the Cart&#34;</a>).</p>
<p>For example, if you do not want object names prefixed with the owner schema name in DDL creation statements (for example, if a generated script should create a BOOKS table and not a SMITH.BOOKS table), <span class="italic">deselect</span> (uncheck) the <span class="bold">Show Schema</span> option.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Default Cart Directory</span>: Default location for the .zip file that contains the generated script files (including the master script file) for a deployment.</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="RPTUG45946"></a>Database: Utilities: Difference</p>
<p>The Difference pane specifies options that affect the behavior of the Database Differences Wizard (see <a href="dialogs.htm#BACIGDDD">Section 5.72, &#34;Database Differences&#34;</a>).</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="CEGBAIAG"></a><a id="RPTUG45372"></a>Database: Utilities: Export</p>
<p>The Export pane determines the default values used for the <a href="dialogs.htm#BACJFIFF">Database Export (Unload Database Objects and Data)</a> wizard and for some other.interfaces.</p>
<p>See also the panes for <a href="#CEGEFICG">Database: Utilities: Export: Formats (CSV, Delimited, Excel, Fixed, HTML, PDF, SQL*Loader, Text, XML)</a></p>
<p><span class="bold">Export/View DDL Options</span>: If this option is checked, the data definition language (DDL) statements for the database objects to be exported are included in the output file, and the other options in this group affect the content and format of the DDL statements.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Pretty Print</span>: If this option is checked, the statements are attractively formatted in the output file, and the size of the file will be larger than it would otherwise be.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Terminator</span>: If this option is checked, a line terminator character is inserted at the end of each line.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Show Schema</span>: If this option is checked, the schema name is included in CREATE statements. If this option is not checked, the schema name is not included in CREATE and INSERT statements, which is convenient if you want to re-create the exported objects and data under a schema that has a different name.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Include Dependents</span>: If this option is checked, objects that are dependent on the objects specified for export are also exported. For nonprivileged users, only dependent objects in their schema are exported; for privileged users, all dependent objects are exported.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Include BYTE Keyword</span>: If this option is checked, column length specifications refer to bytes; if this option is not checked, column length specifications refer to characters.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Add Force to Views</span>: If this option is checked, the FORCE keyword is added to any CREATE VIEW statements (resulting in <code>CREATE OR REPLACE FORCE VIEW</code>...) in the generated DDL during a database export operation. When the script is run later, the FORCE keyword causes the view to be created regardless of whether the base tables of the view or the referenced object types exist or the owner of the schema containing the view has privileges on them.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Include Grants</span>: If this option is checked, GRANT statements are included for any grant objects on the exported objects. (However, grants on objects owned by the SYS schema are never exported.)</p>
<p><span class="bold">Include Drop Statement</span>: If this option is checked, a DROP statement is included before each CREATE statement, to delete any existing objects with the same names. However, you may want to uncheck this option, and create a separate drop script that can be run to remove an older version of your objects before creation. This avoids the chance of accidentally removing an object you did not intend to drop.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Cascade Drops</span>: If this option is checked, the DROP statements include the CASCADE keyword to cause dependent objects to be deleted also.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Storage</span>: If this option is checked, any STORAGE clauses in definitions of the database objects are preserved in the exported DDL statements. If you do not want to use the current storage definitions (for example, if you will re-create the objects in a different system environment), uncheck this option.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Export Data</span>: If this option is checked, the output file or files contain appropriate statements or data for inserting the data for an exported table or view; the specific output format is determined by the <span class="bold">Export Data: Format</span> setting. If this option is not checked, the data for an exported table or view is not exported; that is, only the DDL statements are included. If you check Export Data, all data in all tables in the selected schema is exported, unless you use the Filter Data tab to limit the data to be migrated.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Export Data: Format</span>: Specifies the format to be used for exporting data for a table or view. For example, <code>insert</code> causes SQL INSERT statements to be included to insert the data, <code>loader</code> causes SQL*Loader files to be created, and <code>xls</code> causes a Microsoft Excel .xls file to be created.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Save As</span>: Specifies how the output of an export operation is to be generated. You can also click <span class="bold">Browse</span> to find and select the location for the output:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Single File</span>: A single file contains both DDL and data.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Separate Files</span>: Each object is saved to a separate file in the specified directory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Type Files</span>: Objects of the same type are saved to a single file in the specified directory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Separate Directories</span>: A directory for each object type being exported is created. Files are created in the appropriate directory.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Right Enclosure in Data is Doubled</span> (CSV, Delimited, and Text formats) If this option if checked, then for CSV, delimited, and text format, if the right enclosure occurs in the data, it is doubled in the exported data file.</p>
<p>The <span class="bold">PDF Format</span> options include panes for options specific to cell, column, and table layout, headers and footers, and security. Note that if a table has multiple columns and the columns do not fit horizontally on a PDF page, then the Table Layout Horizontal Alignment option does not apply, but instead the table is split vertically spanning multiple pages and the information on each page is left-aligned.</p>
<p><span class="bold">PDF Format: Column Layout: Binary Large Object Column</span> specifies whether to include BLOBs in the PDF document, to exclude BLOBs from the PDF document (and have the BLOB column be blank), or to create the BLOBs as separate files (in a <span class="italic">filename</span>_blob subdirectory) and create relative links in the PDF file to the BLOB files. (In this case, if you copy the PDF file, you must also remember to copy the <span class="italic">filename</span>_blob subdirectory and its files.) For the relative links option, you have the option to create instead only a .zip file that contains the PDF file and BLOB files.</p>
<p>If a pane includes <span class="bold">Header</span>, this option controls whether the first row is a header row or the first row of data.</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="CEGEBDEH"></a><a id="RPTUG45369"></a>Database: Utilities: Import</p>
<p>The Import pane determines the default values used for the <a href="dialogs.htm#BABGBAJB">Data Import Wizard (Load Data)</a> wizard.</p>
<p>See also the panes for <a href="#CEGDGIHA">Database: Utilities: Import: File Formats (CVS, Delimited, Text)</a> and <a href="#CEGFHFHC">Database: Utilities: Import: Import Methods (External Table, Insert, SQL Loader)</a>.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Default Import Directory</span>: The default folder or directory for files containing data to be imported. You can click <span class="bold">Browse</span> to find and select the folder or directory.</p>
<p><span class="bold">File Encoding</span>: Default character set used for encoding of the data to be imported.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Preview Limit</span>: If this option is checked, it specifies the maximum number of rows of data to be displayed in the preview pane before you proceed with the import operation. The lower the value, the faster the preview pane is populated. When the wizard creates a new table, the preview data is used to calculate the size of the columns; therefore, ensure that the preview is a good sample of the data.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Preview File Read Maximum</span>: Specifies the maximum number of bytes of data to be displayed in the preview pane (if the specified preview row limit has not already been reached) before you proceed with the import operation. (You should set some maximum to ensure that very large files are not inadvertently read into memory.)</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="CEGDGIHA"></a><a id="RPTUG45370"></a>Database: Utilities: Import: File Formats (CVS, Delimited, Text)</p>
<p>A separate pane is provided for specifying default attributes for each supported format for imported data. The displayed and editable attributes depend on the specific format.</p>
<p>If a pane includes <span class="bold">Header</span>, this option controls whether the first row is a header row or the first row of data.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Delimiter</span>: Identifies the character used to separate the data into columns. The delimiter character is not included in the data loaded. If the preview page does not show the data separated into columns, the correct delimiter is probably not specified. Examine the data in the preview area to determine the correct delimiter.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Line Terminator</span>: Identifies the terminator for each line. The line terminator is not included in the data loaded. If the preview page shows the data in one single row, the correct terminator is not specified.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Left Enclosure</span> and <span class="bold">Right Enclosure</span>: Enclosures are used for character data and are optional. Enclosures are not included in the data loaded.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Right Enclosure in Data is Doubled</span>: If this option if checked, then for CSV, delimited, and text format, any right enclosure that is doubled in the data is loaded (imported) as a single right enclosure; also, the data preview will show such data as it will be loaded (that is, double right enclosures will be displayed as single right enclosures in the preview if this option is checked).</p>

<p>A separate pane is provided for specifying default attributes for each supported method or tool to be used for exporting the data. The displayed and editable attributes depend on the specific method.</p>
<p><span class="bold">External Table Method</span> preferences apply to both the External Table method and the Staging External Table method.</p>
<p>Identify Oracle directories for default, log, bad, and discard directories to be used as defaults for the data load. If any of the optional directories are not specified here or in the wizard, the default directory is used. Note these are Oracle directory objects that must be created before the external table can be used, and the appropriate permissions must be granted.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Staging Table Suffix</span>: For Staging External Table, the suffix will be appended to the name of the table to create the name of the external table used as the staging table.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Commit and Drop Staging Table</span>: Indicates the default setting for the commit and drop staging table option. If this option is enabled, the staging table will be dropped and the data will be committed at the end of the load.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Prompt for Save File on Close</span>: If this option is checked, you are prompted to save changes when you close a SQL Worksheet if it contains any unsaved changes. If this option is not checked, any unsaved changes are discarded.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Grid in checker board or zebra pattern</span>: If this option is checked, two different light-colored backgrounds are used for alternating rows of grid displays, to provide some visual contrast. If this option is not checked, all grid rows have a white background.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Max rows to print in a script</span>: Limits the number of rows displayed.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Max lines in script output</span>: Limits the number of lines output.</p>
<p><span class="bold">SQL History Limit</span>: Maximum number of statements that can be stored in the <a href="#CHDDGDHF">SQL History</a>. Must be greater than 0 (zero). If you enter an invalid value, no value is stored in this field.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Default path to look for scripts</span>: The default directory where SQL Developer looks when you run a script (using @). If you type a path, you can specify multiple delimited locations; if you click Browse, you can select a single location. In addition to any path that you specify, SQL Developer looks in the location specified by the SQLPATH environment variable.</p>
<p><a id="sthref326"></a><span class="bold">Save bind variables to disk on exit</span>: If this option is checked, bind variables that you enter when running a script are saved on disk for reuse. If you do not want bind variable values stored on disk (for security or other reasons), be sure not to check this option.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Automatically Freeze Result Tabs</span>: If this option is checked, each pane showing the result of a <a href="#CHDIJIEF">Script Runner</a> query is &#34;pinned&#34; and a new tab is created for each new query&#39;s results. If this option is not checked, the results pane is reused for all queries.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Re-initialize on script exit command</span>: If this option is checked, Script Runner context settings, such as a WHENEVER SQLERROR directive and substitution variables, are cleared when the script exits. If this option is not checked, these context settings are retained. For example, uncheck this option if you want to keep any WHENEVER SQLERROR setting specified in a script after the script exits.</p>

<p>The Migration pane contains options that affect the behavior of SQL Developer when you migrate schema objects and data from third-party databases to an Oracle database.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Default Repository</span>: Migration repository to be used for storing the captured models and converted models. For information about migrating third-party databases to Oracle, including how to create a migration repository, see <a href="migration.htm#CHDECEIA">Chapter 2</a>.</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="RPTUG41462"></a><a id="sthref332"></a>Migration: Data Move Options</p>
<p>The Data Move Options pane contains options that affect the behavior when you migrate data from third-party databases to Oracle Database tables generated by the migration. This pane includes options that can be used for online data migration for all supported third-party databases, and for offline data migration for MySQL, SQL Server, and Sybase Adaptive Server.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Oracle Representation for Zero Length String</span>: The value to which Oracle converts zero-length strings in the source data. Can be a space (&#39; &#39;) or a null value (NULL). Specific notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For Microsoft Access offline migrations, a null value and a space are considered the same.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For Sybase offline migrations, &#39;&#39; is considered the same as a space (&#39; &#39;).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For MySQL offline migrations, a null value is exported as &#39;NULL&#39;, which is handled as type VARCHAR2. You can specify another escape character by using the --fields-escaped-by option with the mysqldump command (for example, specifying <code>\N</code> for null or <code>\\</code> for \). For information about the mysqldump command, see <a href="migration.htm#CHDDDCBC">Section 2.2.8.1.3, &#34;Creating Data Files From MySQL&#34;</a>.</p>
<p>For MySQL offline migrations, the data is exported to a file named <span class="italic">table-name</span>.txt; so if you are moving data from two or more tables with the same name but in different schemas, rename files as needed so that they are all unique, and modify the SQL*Loader .ctl file accordingly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bold">Online</span>: The online data move options determine the results of files created when you click <span class="bold">Migration</span>, then <span class="bold">Migrate Data</span>.</p>
<p><a id="sthref333"></a><a id="sthref334"></a><span class="bold">Number of Parallel Data Move Streams</span> (online data moves): The number of internal connections created for simultaneous movement of data from the source database to the Oracle tables. Higher values may shorten the total time required, but will use more database resources during that time.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Number of Rows to Commit After</span> (online data moves): During the data move operation, Oracle pauses to perform an automatic internal commit operation after each number of rows that you specify are moved from the source database to Oracle tables.</p>
<p>Lower values will cause a successful move operation to take more time; but if a failure occurs, it is likely that more source records will exist in the Oracle tables and that if the move operation is resumed, fewer source records will need to be moved. Higher values will cause a successful move operation to take less time; but if a failure occurs, it is likely that fewer source records will exist in the Oracle tables and that is the move operation is resumed, more source records will need to be moved.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Offline</span>: The offline data move options determine the results of files created, such as when you click <span class="bold">Tools</span>, then <span class="bold">Migration</span>, then <span class="bold">Create Database Capture Scripts</span>.</p>
<p><span class="bold">End of Column Delimiter</span> (offline data moves): String to indicate end of column.</p>
<p><span class="bold">End of Row Delimiter</span> (offline data moves): String to indicate end of row.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Generic Date Mask</span> (offline data moves): Format mask for dates, unless overridden by user-defined custom preferences.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Generic Timestamp Mask</span> (offline data moves): Format mask for timestamps, unless overridden by user-defined custom preferences.</p>
<p><span class="bold">User-Defined Custom Preferences by Source Type</span> (offline data moves): Lets you specify, for one or more source data types, a custom mapping for the function and format mask. Add one row for each mapping. For example, the following rows specify the Source Type, Function, and Mask for custom mappings for the Sybase data types <code>datetime</code>, <code>smalldatetime</code>, and <code>time</code>:</p>
<pre>datetime       TO_TIMESTAMP  mon dd yyyy hh:mi:ss:ff3am

<p>The Generation Options pane contains options that are used when generating .sql script files for creating migrated database objects in the target schema.</p>
<p><span class="bold">One single file</span> or <span class="bold">A file per object</span>: Determines how many files are created and their relative sizes. Having more files created might be less convenient, but may allow more flexibility with complex migration scenarios.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Generate Comments</span>: Generates comments in the Oracle SQL statements.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Generate Controlling Script</span>: Generates a &#34;master&#34; script for running all the required files.</p>
<p><span class="bold"><a id="sthref335"></a>Least Privilege Schema Migration</span>: For migrating schema objects in a converted model to Oracle, causes CREATE USER, GRANT, and CONNECT statements <span class="italic">not</span> to be generated in the output scripts. You must then ensure that the scripts are run using a connection with sufficient privileges. You can select this option if the database user and connection that you want to use to run the scripts already exist, or if you plan to create them.</p>
<p><span class="bold"><a id="sthref336"></a><a id="sthref337"></a>Generate Data Move User</span>: For data move operations, creates an additional database user with extra privileges to perform the operation. It is recommended that you delete this user after the operation. This option is provided for convenience, and is suggested unless you want to perform least privilege migrations or unless you want to grant privileges manually to a user for the data move operations. This option is especially recommended for multischema migrations, such as when not all tables belong to a single user.</p>
<p><span class="bold"><a id="sthref338"></a><a id="sthref339"></a>Generate Failed Objects</span>: Causes objects that failed to be converted to be included in the generation script, so that you can make any desired changes and then run the script. If this option is not checked, objects that failed to be converted are not included in the generation script.</p>
<p><span class="bold"><a id="sthref340"></a><a id="sthref341"></a>Generate Stored Procedure for Migrate Blobs Offline</span>: Causes a stored procedure named CLOBtoBLOB_sqldeveloper (with execute access granted to public) to be created if the schema contains a BLOB (binary large object); this procedure is automatically called if you perform an offline capture. If this option is not checked, you will need to use the manual workaround described in <a href="migration.htm#CHDEAJCE">Section 2.2.8.1.4, &#34;Populating the Destination Database Using the Data Files&#34;</a>. (After the offline capture, you can delete the CLOBtoBLOB_sqldeveloper procedure or remove execute access from public.)</p>
<p><span class="bold"><a id="sthref342"></a><a id="sthref343"></a>Generate Separate Emulation User</span>: Causes a separate database user named EMULATION to be created. The emulation package is created in the new EMULATION schema and is referenced by all other migrated users. If this option is not checked, no separate EMULATION user is created, and the emulation package is created within each migrated user. Generating a separate emulation user is usually the best practice because the emulation package is defined in one place, rather than having multiple copies of it. However, if you prefer each migrated user to be standalone and not need to reference anything from another user, then uncheck this option.</p>
<p><span class="bold"><a id="sthref344"></a><a id="sthref345"></a>(Sybase) <a id="sthref346"></a><a id="sthref347"></a>To Index-Organized Tables</span>: Controls whether Sybase clustered unique constraints or clustered primary keys are converted to Oracle index-organized tables. <code>NONE</code> causes neither to be converted to index-organized tables (they are converted to Oracle unique constraints and primary keys, respectively). <code>From Clustered Unique Constraints</code> converts each clustered constraint into a primary key and creates an index-organized table if there is no primary key already. <code>From Clustered Primary Keys</code> creates an index-organized table if the primary key is clustered (the Sybase default).</p>
<p><span class="bold"><a id="sthref348"></a><a id="sthref349"></a>Use All Oracle Database 12c Features in Migration</span> (if using the Oracle JDBC Driver Release 12<span class="italic">c</span> or higher): Allows the migrated objects in the target Oracle Database schema to use features that are new in Oracle Database 12<span class="italic">c</span> (Release 12.1). If this option is not checked, features that are new in Oracle Database 12<span class="italic">c</span> will not be considered for inclusion. Checking this option also adds <code>QUOTA UNLIMITED ON SYSTEM</code> to the CREATE USER statements in generated scripts. For example (for a user named <code>Emulation</code>):</p>
<pre>CREATE USER Emulation IDENTIFIED BY Emulation DEFAULT TABLESPACE SYSTEM TEMPORARY TABLESPACE TEMP <span class="bold">QUOTA UNLIMITED ON SYSTEM</span>;
GRANT CREATE SESSION, RESOURCE, CREATE VIEW, CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW, CREATE SYNONYM, CREATE PUBLIC SYNONYM, ALTER SESSION, CREATE SQL TRANSLATION PROFILE TO Emulation;
</pre>
<p>(If you want to use a different tablespace than <code>SYSTEM</code>, modify the scripts accordingly.)</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="CHDCBDAC"></a><a id="RPTUG41464"></a>Migration: Identifier Options</p>
<p>The Identifier Options pane contains options that apply to object identifiers during migrations.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Prepended to All Identifier Names</span> (Microsoft Access, Microsoft SQL Server, and Sybase Adaptive Server migrations only): A string to be added at the beginning of the name of migrated objects. For example, if you specify the string as XYZ_, and if a source table is named EMPLOYEES, the migrated table will be named XYZ_EMPLOYEES. (Be aware of any object name length restrictions if you use this option.)</p>
<p><span class="bold">Is Quoted Identifier On</span> (Microsoft SQL Server and Sybase Adaptive Server migrations only): If this option is enabled, quotation marks (double-quotes) can be used to refer to identifiers (for example, SELECT &#34;Col 1&#34; from &#34;Table 1&#34;); if this option is not enabled, quotation marks identify string literals. <span class="bold">Important</span>: The setting of this option must match the setting in the source database to be migrated, as explained in <a href="migration.htm#i1005806">Section 2.2.4.2, &#34;Before Migrating From Microsoft SQL Server or Sybase Adaptive Server&#34;</a>.</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="RPTUG41465"></a>Migration: Translators</p>
<p>The Translators pane contains options that relate to conversion of stored procedures and functions from their source database format to Oracle format. (These options apply only to migrations from Microsoft Access, Microsoft SQL Server, and Sybase Adaptive Server.)</p>
<p><span class="bold">Default Source Date Format</span>: Default date format mask to be used when casting string literals to dates in stored procedures and functions.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Variable Name Prefix</span>: String to be used as the prefix in the names of resulting variables.</p>
<p><span class="bold">In Parameter Prefix</span>: String to be used as the prefix in the names of resulting input parameters.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Query Assignment Translation</span>: Option to determine what is generated for a query assignment: only the assignment, assignment with exception handling logic, or assignment using a cursor LOOP ... END LOOP structure to fetch each row of the query into variables.</p>
<p><span class="bold"><a id="sthref350"></a><a id="sthref351"></a>Display AST</span>: If this option is checked, the abstract syntax tree (AST) is displayed in the Source Tree pane of the Translation Scratch Editor window (described in <a href="migration.htm#CHDCJDBJ">Section 2.3.5</a>) if you perform a translation.</p>
<p><a id="sthref352"></a><a id="sthref353"></a><span class="bold">Generate Compound Triggers</span>: If this option is checked, then depending on the source code, SQL Developer can convert a Sybase or SQL Server trigger to an Oracle compound trigger, which uses two temporary tables to replicate the inserted and deleted tables in Sybase and SQL Server.

<p>Versioning preferences affect the behavior of the version control and management systems that you can use with SQL Developer. You can specify preferences for CVS and Subversion. For information about using versioning with SQL Developer, see <a href="#CHDIICEH">Section 1.10, &#34;Using Versioning&#34;</a>.</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="RPTUG41468"></a><a id="sthref364"></a>Versioning: CVS</p>
<p>The CVS pane specifies options for use with CVS (Concurrent Versions System).</p>
<p><span class="bold">CVS Client</span>: <span class="bold">Internal to Oracle SQL Developer</span> (installed with SQL Developer) or <span class="bold">External Executable</span> (separately installed CVS client, for which you must specify the name or path).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Name on System Path</span>: Name of the CVS server executable. The default (cvs) is correct for most installations. This option assumes that the name of the CVS server executable is on the system path.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Path from Environment</span>: Location of the CVS server executable, especially if there is more than one on the system path. The selection area will list all instances of the CVS server executable known to the local system. You may have more than one version of CVS installed: this option lets you specify which of them to use with SQL Developer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Other Path</span>: Location of the CVS server executable, if it is not on the system path at all.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bold">Run CVS in Edit/Watch Mode</span>: If this option is enabled, you coordinate access to files by declaring an editor for them through CVS, after which they may be modified. Only those files that you check out after changing this preference will be affected. If this option is disabled, the edit and watch commands on the Versioning menu are disabled.</p>
<p><span class="bold">State Overlay Scheme</span>: Scheme for the icons displayed alongside folder and file names in the navigators to indicate their versioning status.</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="RPTUG41469"></a>Versioning: CVS: Commands</p>
<p>The CVS: Commands pane sets options for CVS source control. Some options are not available when using the internal CVS client.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Enable Advanced Controls</span>: If this option is enabled, advanced CVS controls are shown in dialog boxes. If you find that you use only basic CVS features, you might wish to use SQL Developer without advanced controls, to reduce complexity and save screen space.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Global Options: Run Quietly</span>: If this option is enabled, informational messages are suppressed.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Global Options: Do not Log Commands</span>: If this option is enabled, CVS commands are not logged in the repository command history.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Global Options: Encrypt</span>: If this option is enabled, all communication between the client and the server is encrypted. Encryption support is not available in CVS by default; it must be enabled using a special configuration option when you build CVS.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Set Compression Level (z)</span>: If this option is enabled, you can set the compression level for files sent between client and server. The level can be set from Minimum (high speed, low compression) to Maximum (low speed, high compression).</p>
<p><span class="bold">Keyword Substitution Mode</span>: CVS uses keyword substitution modes to insert revision information into files when they are checked out or updated. This option controls the mode of replacement for keyword substitution in versioned files:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Automatic</span>: The default, recommended option.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Keyword-Only Mode</span>: Generates only keyword names in keyword strings and omits their values. This option is useful for disregarding differences due to keyword substitution when comparing different revisions of a file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Keyword-Value Mode</span>: Generates keyword strings using the default form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Keyword-Value-Locker Mode</span>: Like the keyword-value mode, except that the name of the locker is always inserted if the given revision is currently locked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Old-Contents Mode</span>: Generates the old keyword string, present in the working file just before it was checked in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Value-Only Mode</span>: Generates only keyword values for keyword strings. This can help generate files in programming languages where it is hard to strip keyword delimiters from a string. However, further keyword substitution cannot be performed once the keyword names are removed, so this option should be used with care.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bold">On Commit: Use Comment Templates</span>: If this option is enabled, your commit comments will be entered through template forms. The forms are set up by the CVS system administrator. There may be different forms for different circumstances and installations, and it may be that none of them are suitable for your commit comments. In this case, this preference lets you disable the use of all forms.</p>
<p><span class="bold">On Commit: Automatically Add Files</span>: If this option is enabled, local files are added to the CVS repository whenever you perform a commit action.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Create Backup Files on Remove</span>: If this option is enabled, backup copies are made of files that are removed through actions of the source control system.</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="RPTUG41470"></a>Versioning: CVS: General</p>
<p>The CVS: General pane specifies environment settings and the operation timeout.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Use Navigator State Overlay Icons</span>: If this option is enabled, state overlay icons are used. State overlay icons are small symbols associated with object names in the navigators. They indicate the state of version-controlled files (for example, &#34;up to date&#34;).</p>
<p><span class="bold">Use Navigator State Overlay Labels</span>: If this option is enabled, state overlay labels are used. State overlay labels are tooltips associated with object names in the navigators.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Automatically Make Files Editable</span>: If this option is enabled, an editor is automatically used on a data file when you start to change it. (If you edit a file unintentionally, immediately use Versioning, then Unedit to revert.)</p>

<p>The CVS: Version Tools pane specifies options for the pending changes window and the merge editor.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Use Outgoing Changes Commit Dialog</span>: Enables you to make optimum use of limited screen space when the Pending Changes window is open. You can save screen space by not showing the Comments area of the Pending Changes window, but you might still want to add comments before a commit action. You can choose the circumstances under which the Commit dialog is opened: always, only when the Comments area of the Pending Changes window is hidden, or never.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Incoming Changes Timer Interval</span>: The frequency at which the change status of files is checked.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Merge Editor</span>: Specifies whether files are merged locally or at the server.</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="RPTUG41473"></a><a id="sthref365"></a>Versioning: Subversion</p>

You can move the horizontal divider to change the pane sizes (for example, to make the Contents pane narrower, to allow more room for the help topic content). You can also resize and reposition the Help Center window.</p>
<p>For Search, you can click the icon (binoculars) to see search options: case sensitive (Match case) or case insensitive; and whether to match topics based on all specified words, any specified words, or a Boolean expression.</p>
<p>The <span class="bold">Keep on Top</span> button toggles whether the Help Center window is kept on top of the display when you switch focus (click) back in the SQL Developer window.</p>
