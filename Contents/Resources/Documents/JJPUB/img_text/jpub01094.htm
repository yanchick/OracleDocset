<p>This is a flowchart showing inputs and outputs for the JPublisher publishing process, as described in the accompanying text. In addition to these descriptions, the graphic shows the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Input to JPublisher through the command line, properties file, or <code>INPUT</code> file that includes SQL object types, SQL collection types, PL/SQL packages, server-side Java classes, <code>SELECT</code>/<code>UPDATE</code>/<code>INSERT</code>/<code>DELETE</code> statements, or WSDL files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The SQLJ translator, which is invoked by JPublisher, is depicted as an entity within the JPublisher product. In contrast, the Java compiler is shown as an external entity. SQLJ source files are shown as the input to the SQLJ translator and Java source files are the output. Java source files, either from the SQLJ translator or generated directly by JPublisher in some circumstances, are shown as input to the Java compiler and Java class files (<code>.class</code>) as the output.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>JPublisher <code>.class</code> output is shown as optionally going to the database JVM or the client-side or middle-tier JVM. Classes for Web services call-outs are loaded in the database JVM by default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>JPublisher<code>.sql</code> output, which consists of PL/SQL wrappers and scripts, is shown as optionally going to the database PL/SQL engine. If this happens, it happens by default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The database is shown to include the PL/SQL engine and database JVM, which includes the SQLJ run time and JDBC driver. The database is also shown to include the metadata that JPublisher checks for defintions of SQL types, PL/SQL packages, and shapes of query results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User-defined classes, including subclasses of JPublisher-generated classes, are shown as going to the client-side or middle-tier JVM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The client-side or middle-tier JVM is shown to include the SQLJ run time and JDBC driver.</p>
</li>
</ul>
