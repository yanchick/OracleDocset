<p>In this entity-relationship diagram, a customer&#39;s phone number attribute is a collection that can contain zero to ten phone numbers.</p>
<p>A customer&#39;s address is modeled as a single Address object, which contains the attributes Street, City, State, and Zip. The Address object associated with a customer is also used by any Purchase Order objects associated with that customer. In a Purchase Order, the customer&#39;s address is used as the shipping address.</p>
<p>A Purchase Order contains as an attribute a collection of one or more Line Items. Each Line Item refers to one Stock Item.</p>
