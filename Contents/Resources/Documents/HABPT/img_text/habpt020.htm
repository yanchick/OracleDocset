<p>This figure shows the steps in the process of performing a rolling upgrade using a transient logical standby database. The configuration starts out with the primary and physical standby databases running Oracle Database release <span class="italic">x</span> before the physical standby is converted into the logical standby role. The transient logical standby database is upgraded from release <span class="italic">x</span> to release <span class="italic">y</span> and then a switchover is performed. When the logical standby database becomes the new primary database, this has the effect of automatically upgrading the new primary database to release <span class="italic">y</span>. As the original primary database is transitioned to the logical standby role, SQL Apply synchronizes the new logical standby database with the new primary database, which has the effect of automatically upgrading the new logical standby database to release <span class="italic">y</span>.</p>
<p>Next, the new logical standby database is returned to the physical standby database role, Redo Apply is started, and the physical standby database is automatically upgraded to release <span class="italic">y</span> as the primary and physical standby databases are synchronized. The figure shows the optional final step in which a switchover is performed to return the databases to their original (pre-upgrade) roles.</p>
