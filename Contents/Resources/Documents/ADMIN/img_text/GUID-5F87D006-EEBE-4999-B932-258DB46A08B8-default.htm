<p>This image is a screenshot of the Support Workbench home page. It contains the following three subpages: Problems, Checker Findings, and Packages. The Problems subpage is currently shown. This subpage has the following sections:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p>An incident and problem summary, which includes six read-only fields organized across the page in two rows and three columns. The fields contain statistics on the number of incidents and problems in the ADR.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A search section that includes a list that enables you to choose the period from which to show problems (the default is 24 hours, however, the setting shown in the image is &#34;Last Week&#34;), a search field with a Go button, and an Advanced Search link.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A table of problems. The table shows 4 rows (for 4 problems) and contains the following columns: Select, Details, ID, Description, Number Of Incidents, Last Incident, Last Comment, Active, Packaged, and SR#. Above the table are two buttons: View and Package. The Details column contains a Show/Hide icon, which when clicked, displays all incidents for the problem below the problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Performance and Critical Error Timeline section, which displays a graphical timeline of session activity above the x axis, and different colored 1/8&#34; dots below the x axis, representing occurrences of incidents within the timeline. Each color represents a different problem. Below the dots is a legend of problem names (for example, ORA 600 [13001]) and corresponding colors. To the right of the graph is a legend that differentiates the traces on the graph by color. The three colors represent CPU, User I/O, and Wait.</p>
</li>
</ul>
