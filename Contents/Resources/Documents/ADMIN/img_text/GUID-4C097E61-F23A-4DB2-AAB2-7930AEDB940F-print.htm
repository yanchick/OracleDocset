MAIL_POSTMAN_GROUP receives 40% of the CPU at level 1, MAIL_USERS_GROUP receives 80% of the CPU at level 2, and MAIL_MAINTENANCE_GROUP receives 20 percent of the CPU at level 2. OTHER_GROUPS receives 100 percent of the CPU at level 3.There are also three groups (and the mandatory OTHER_GROUPS) that consume resources in the BUGDB_PLAN. The BUG_ONLINE_GROUP receives 80 percent of the resources at level 1, the BUG_BATCH_GROUP receives 20 percent of the resources at level 1, and the BUG_MAINTENANCE_GROUP receives 100 percent of the resources at level 2.
