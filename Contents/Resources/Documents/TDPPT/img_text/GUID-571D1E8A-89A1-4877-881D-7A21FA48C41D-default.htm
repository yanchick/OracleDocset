<p>This screenshot shows the Metrics subpage in the Details group on the Monitored SQL Execution Details: DBOP_EXAMPLE page. The Metrics subpage has the following groups: CPU Used, Memory, IO Throughput, and IO Requests.</p>
<p>The CPU Used group has a chart that shows the number of CPU cores and the number of CPUs in use over time. The y-axis of the chart is the number of CPUs used and the x-axis is times of day. The y-axis values start at 2:45:30 p.m. and go to approximately 2:47:30 p.m. The number of CPU Cores is 2. and the number of cores in use varied repeatedly from approximately .48 to approximately 99 during the time period.</p>
<p>The Memory group has the subpages PGA Usage and Temp Usage. The PGA Usage subpage is visible. The subpage has a graph that shows the amount of PGA usage over time. The chart shows approximately 0 MB of PGA usage from 2:45:30 p.m. to approximately 2:47:00 p.m.</p>
<p>The IO Throughput group has the subpages Storage and Buffer Cache. The Storage subpage is visible. The subpage has a graph that shows the amount of storage for IO interconnect bytes, write bytes, and read bytes. The chart shows 0 megabytes of storage used from 2:45:30 p.m. to approximately 2:47:00 p.m. with spikes in usage of approximately 6.23 megabytes at approximately 2:46:58.</p>
<p>The IO Requests group has a chart that shows the number of read and write requests per second over time. The y-axis of the chart is the number of requests and the x-axis is times of day. The chart shows 0 requests from 2:45:30 p.m. to approximately 2:47:30 p.m. except for at approximately 2:47:00 when the number of write requests was approximately 100 and at 2:47:25 when the number of write requests was approximately 450.</p>
