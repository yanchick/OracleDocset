The units of the y-axis of the chart are average active sessions, which range from 0 to 1.2. The units of the x-axis are times of the day, shown in 5-minute intervals. The marked times range from 1:55 p.m. to 2:45 p.m. A shaded slider area covers the time from about 2:02 to 2:07.</p>

<p>Below those fields is an area that contains rectangular boxes that represent dimensions. Each box has a label that indicates the dimension category. A box may be subdivided into other boxes that the type of activity in that category. The relative area of a box indicates the amount of the average active sessions consumed by the dimension or category. In the middle of each box is a label for the category.
