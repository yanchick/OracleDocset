<p>The Overall Workload Performance section has an information icon (the letter i in a chat bubble) followed by the words, &#34;Potential for Improvement.&#34;</p>
<p>The Workload I/O Cost section has a bar chart that compares the workload I/O cost for the Original Cost (323818), indicated by a red bar, with the New Cost (298034)), indicated by a smaller blue bar. The vertical axis measures the workload I/O cost, with values from 290,000 to 330,000 in increments of 10,000.</p>
<p>The Query Execution Time Improvement section also has a bar chart. The vertical axis is the percentage of statements, and has values from 0 to 100 incrementing by 25. The horizontal axis measures the Query Improvement Factor with values of 1x, 2x, 4x, 6x, 8x, 10x, and &gt;10x. The legend contains only 2 entries: No Performance Improvement, represented by the gray bars and Potential Performance Improvement, represented by the blue bars. The graph indicates that 50% of the queries would see no improvement, as indicated by the large gray bar at 1x. Approximately 20% of the statements have a potential query execution time improvement of 4x, and approximately 29% of the statements have a potential query execution time improvement of greater than 10x, as indicated by the blue bars at 4x and &gt;10x.
