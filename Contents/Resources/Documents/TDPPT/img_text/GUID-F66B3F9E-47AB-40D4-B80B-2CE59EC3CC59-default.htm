<p>The Disk Details page is shown.</p>
<p>On the top right of the screenshot is a label-value pair. The label is Latest Data Collected From Target and the value is Jan 6, 2012 1:05:56 p.m. CST. Next to the value is a refresh button.</p>
<p>Below the label-value pair is the View Data list, with Real Time: Manual Refresh showing.</p>
<p>This page contains three sections: Total Disk I/O Made Across All Disks, Max Average Disk I/O Service Time (ms) Among All Disks, and Top Disk Devices (ordered by % Busy).</p>
<p>The Total Disk I/O Made Across All Disks chart ranges from 0 to 1500 on the y-axis and 11:46 AM to 1:00 p.m. on the x-axis. The chart measure Total I/Os per second across all disks. The chart shows a jagged line ranging from about 100 at 11:46 up to 800 at about 12:17, to a peak at 1000 at 12:50, and then down to 200 at 1:10. Below the x-axis is the date Jan 6, 2012. Below the date is a link: Total Disk I/O made across all disks. Below the chart is a label-value pair. The label is Total I/O made across all disks per second and the value is 153.07.</p>
<p>The Max Average Disk I/O Service Time (ms) Among All Disks chart ranges from 0 to 7.5 on the y-axis and from 12:16 to 1:06 on the x-axis. The chart measures the maximum average disk I/O service time in milliseconds among all disks. The chart shows a jagged line ranging from 2 at 12:16 up to around 6 at 12:35, and then down to 2 at 1:06. Below the x-axis is the date Jan 6, 2012. Below the date is a link: Max Average Disk I/O Service Time (ms) among. Below the chart is a label-value pair. The label is Max Average Disk I/O Service Time (ms) among all disks and the value is 1.79.</p>
<p>The Top Disk Devices (ordered by % Busy) section includes a table. The columns of the table are: Status, Device, Busy (%), Average Outstanding Requests, Reads per second, Writes per second, Blocks Read (512 bytes per second). Other columns not visible in this screenshot of the page are: Blocks Written (512 bytes per second, Average Wait Time (ms), Average Service Time (ms).</p>
<p>Two rows are visible in the table. The values in the columns are the following:</p>
<p>Row 1: (check mark icon), xvda, 12.14, 19.88, 31.11, 45.6, 907.08.</p>
<p>Row 2: (check mark icon), xvda1, 10.93, 21.4, 27.96, 32.12, 774.04.</p>
