<p>The screenshot shows the top portion of the Cluster Database Performance page, which contains from top to bottom the Cluster Host Load Average, Global Cache Block Access Latency, Average Active Sessions, and Database Throughput charts. Each chart has a title on the top left side of the chart, axis labels, a date at the bottom left side of the chart, and a legend box to the right of the chart. On each chart, the horizontal axis shows the time in five minute increments. Each chart has different lines on it to represent different performance statistics measured.</p>
<p>The Cluster Host Load Average chart has the label Runnable processes for the vertical axis. The legend for this chart lists Maximum, Average, and Minimum.</p>
<p>The Global Cache Block Access Latency chart has the label Milli-Seconds for the vertical axis. The legend for this chart lists Average Current Block Receive Time and Average CR Block Receive Time.</p>
<p>The Average Active Sessions chart has the label Active Sessions for the vertical axis. The legend for this chart lists Other, Cluster, Queueing, Network, Administrative, Configuration, Commit, Application, Concurrency, System I/O, User I/O, Scheduler, and CPU Used. The majority of the data on the chart is for the Other category, which is colored bright pink and fluctuates around the 2.0 mark.</p>
<p>The Database Throughput chart, of which only half is shown, has the label Per Second for the vertical axis. The legend for this chart lists Logons and Transactions. There is an option to change the vertical axis to display Per Transaction. At the top of the chart are the following tabs: I/O, Parallel Execution, Services, and Instances.</p>
<p>The text following the screenshot provides a description of the charts in a table, and lists the additional monitoring links that are available at the bottom of the Performance page, but not shown in the screenshot.</p>
