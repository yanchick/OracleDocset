<p>The screenshot shows the Average Current Block Receive Time By Instance page, which contains two charts: Summary chart on the top, Maximum, Average, and Minimum chart on the bottom. The introductory text for this page says &#34;Click on an area of the summary chart or an instance name in the chart legend to view additional metric details for the instance.</p>
<p>Each chart has a title on the top left side of the chart, a label for the vertical axis, time stamps at the bottom of the chart, and a legend box to the right of the chart. On each chart, the horizontal axis shows the time in ten minute increments. The Summary chart uses shaded areas to represent each instance, and the Maximum, Average, and Minimum chart uses lines to represent the different values.</p>
<p>The Summary chart has the label Milli-Seconds for the vertical axis. The legend for this chart lists the name of the two available instances, cvudb1 and cvudb2.</p>
<p>The Maximum, Average, Minimum chart has the label Milli-Seconds for the vertical axis and uses the numbers 0, 3, and 6. The legend for this chart lists Maximum, Average, and Minimum. Below this chart is the following text: &#34;The Maximum, Average, and Minimum chart shows the maximum, average, and minimum values for the metric for all active cluster database instances.&#34;</p>
<p>In the top-left corner of the page is the Metric list, which can be used to change the metric displayed on the page. Currently it is set to Average Current Block Receive Time. Below this list are two options: Tile Chart and Summary Chart. Currently the option Summary Chart is selected.</p>
<p>The data graphed in each chart has roughly the same shape, with peaks (approximately 6 milliseconds) at 9:34, 9:36 and 10:01 AM. The highest peaks are related to the cvudb1 instance in the Summary chart, and to Maximum in the Maximum, Average, and Minimum chart. The charts also show smaller peaks (about 1 to 2 milliseconds) at 9:30, 9:35, 9:46, 9:47, 9:51, 9:45, 10:04, 10:06 and 10:16 AM. There is a period of steady activity shown in the chart from 10:16 AM to 10:20 AM, at which point the activity drops back to zero. The smaller peaks in the graph occur for both the cvudb2 and cvudb1 instance. These smaller peaks in the Summary chart correspond with small peaks in the Maximum, Average, and Minimum chart, and are associated with either Maximum or Average. The line in the Maximum, Average, and Minimum chart that corresponds to the Minimum value is an almost completely flat line, with a value of 0 milliseconds.</p>
<p>In the top-right corner of the page is the View Data list, which is currently set to Real Time: 15 Second Refresh. Below this list is the Customize button.</p>
