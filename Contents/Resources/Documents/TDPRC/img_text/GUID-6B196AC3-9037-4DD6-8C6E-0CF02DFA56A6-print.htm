<p>The illustration shows two different shared storage locations at the top of the image. The first shared storage location contains the Archived Redo Log Files. The files in this section are labeled 1_001 on one side, and 2_001, 2_002, 2_003 on the other side.</p>
<p>In the second shared storage location, the Online Redo Log Files are stored. On the left-hand side is a group of files labeled Thread 1. These files are Log 1_001, Log 1_002 and Log 1_003. On the right-hand side is a group of three files labeled Thread 2. The files in this group are Log 2_004, Log 2_005, and Log 2_003.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the image is an Oracle RAC database with 2 instances. Each instance is represented as a cylinder. Each instance has two boxes drawn on top of the cylinder with LGWR in one and ARC0 in the other.</p>
<p>For Instance 1, the LGWR box points to the Thread 1 group in the Online Redo Log Files storage area. The ARC0 box for Instance 1 is connected to the 1_001 archived redo log file. For Instance 2, the LGWR box points to the Thread 2 group in the Online Redo Log Files storage area. The ARC0 box for Instance 2 is connected to the 2_001, 2_002, and 2_003 archived redo log files.</p>
