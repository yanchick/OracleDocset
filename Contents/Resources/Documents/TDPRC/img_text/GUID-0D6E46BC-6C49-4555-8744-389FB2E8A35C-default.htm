<p>The screenshot shows the Performance subpage for the cluster. On the left-hand side of the page, at the top, are two options: Summary Chart (selected) and Tile Chart (not selected).</p>
<p>There are 3 charts displayed in the screenshot: CPU Utilization, Memory Utilization, and Disk I/O Utilization.</p>
<p>The CPU Utilization chart measures the number of CPUs on the vertical axis. There are two lines on the chart, each line representing a different host.</p>
<p>The Memory Utilization chart measures the percentage of memory utilized on the vertical axis. There are four lines on the chart, each line representing a different host. All of the lines are straight, with the host racbi05 showing a constant memory utilization of 3.7% and the other hosts showing a constant memory utilization of around 2.5%.</p>
<p>The Disk I/O Utilization chart measures the Total I/Os per second on the vertical axis using values from 0 to 16, in increments of 2. There are three lines on the chart, each line representing a different host. The host racbi08 has a straight line at 16. The host racbi06 has a straight line at 8, and the host racbi07 starts at 16 and drops down to 8.</p>
