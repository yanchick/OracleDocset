<h1 class="appendix"><span class="secnum">A</span> Designing a Dimensional Model</h1>
<p>This guide uses the Global schema for its examples. This appendix explores the business requirements of the fictitious Global Computing Company and discusses how the design of a data model emerges from these requirements.</p>
<p>This appendix contains the following topics:</p>

<div id="OLAUG9295" class="sect1">
<h2 class="sect1">Case Study Scenario</h2>
<p>The fictional Global Computing Company was established in 1990. Global Computing distributes computer hardware and software components to customers on a worldwide basis. The Sales and Marketing department has not been meeting its budgeted numbers. As a result, this department has been challenged to develop a successful sales and marketing strategy.</p>
<p>Global Computing operates in an extremely competitive market. Competitors are numerous, customers are especially price-sensitive, and profit margins tend to be narrow. In order to grow profitably, Global Computing must increase sales of its most profitable products.</p>
<p>Various factors in Global Computing&#39;s current business point to a decline in sales and profits:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Traditionally, Global Computing experiences low third-quarter sales (July through September). However, recent sales in other quarters have also been lower than expected. The company has experienced bursts of growth but, for no apparent reason, has had lower first-quarter sales during the last two years as compared with prior years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Global has been successful with its newest sales channel, the Internet. Although sales within this channel are growing, overall profits are declining.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perhaps the most significant factor is that margins on personal computers - previously the source of most of Global Computing&#39;s profits - are declining rapidly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Global Computing must understand how each of these factors is affecting its business.</p>
<p>Current reporting is done by the IT department, which produces certain standard reports on a monthly basis. Any ad hoc reports are handled on an as-needed basis and are subject to the time constraints of the limited IT staff. Complaints have been widespread within the Sales and Marketing department regarding the delayed response to report requests. Complaints have also been numerous in the IT department regarding analysts who change their minds frequently or ask for further information.</p>
<p>The Sales and Marketing department has been struggling with a lack of timely information about what it is selling, who is buying, and how they are buying. In a meeting with the CIO, the VP of Sales and Marketing states, &#34;By the time I get the information, it is no longer useful. I am only able to get information at the end of each month, and it does not have the details I need to do my job.&#34;</p>
<div id="OLAUG9296" class="sect2"><a id="sthref696"></a>
<h3 class="sect2">Reporting Requirements</h3>
<p><a id="ABC1131034"></a>When asked to be more specific about what she needs, the Vice President of Sales and Marketing identifies the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Trended sales data for specific customers, regions, and segments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ability to provide information and some analysis capabilities to the field sales force. A web interface would be preferred, since the sales force is distributed throughout the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Detail regarding mail-order, phone, and email sales on a monthly and quarterly basis, and a comparison to past time periods. Information must identify when, how, and what is being sold by each channel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Margin information on products to understand the dollar contribution for each sale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knowledge of percent change versus the prior and year-ago period for sales, units, and margin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ability to perform analysis of the data by ad hoc groupings.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The CIO has discussed these requirements with his team and has concluded that a standard reporting solution against the production order entry system would not be flexible enough to provide the required analysis capabilities. The reporting requirements for business analysis are so diverse that the projected cost of development, along with the expected turnaround time for requests, would make this solution unacceptable.</p>
<p>The CIO&#39;s team recommends using an analytic workspace to support analysis. The team suggests that the Sales and Marketing department&#39;s IT group work with Corporate IT to build an analytic workspace that meets their needs for information analysis.</p>
</div>

<a id="CHDHGDCH"></a>
<div id="OLAUG9297" class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">Business Goals</h3>
<p>The development team identifies the following high-level business goals that the project must meet:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Global Computing&#39;s strategic goal is to increase company profits by increasing sales of higher margin products and by increasing sales volume overall.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Sales and Marketing department objectives are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Analyze industry trends and target specific market segments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Analyze sales channels and increase profits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify product trends and create a strategy for developing the appropriate channels.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<!-- class="sect2" -->
<div id="OLAUG9298" class="sect2"><a id="sthref697"></a>
<h3 class="sect2">Information Requirements</h3>
<p>Once you have established business goals, you can determine the type of information that helps achieve these goals. To understand how end users examine the data in the analytic workspace, it is important to conduct extensive interviews. From interviews with key end users, you can determine how they look at the business, and what types of business analysis questions they want to answer.</p>
<div id="OLAUG9299" class="sect3"><a id="sthref698"></a>
<h4 class="sect3">Business Analysis Questions</h4>
<p>Interviews with the VP of Sales and Marketing, salespeople, and market analysts at Global Computing reveal the following business analysis questions:</p>

<h4 class="sect3">Summary of Information Requirements</h4>
<p>By examining the types of analyses that users want to perform, we can identify the following key requirements for analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Global Computing has a strong need for profitability analysis. The company must understand profitability by product, account, market segment, and distribution channel. It also must understand profitability trends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Global Computing must understand how sales vary by time of year. The company must understand these seasonal trends by product, geographic area, market segment, and distribution channel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Global Computing has a need for ad hoc sales analysis. Analysis must identify what products are sold to whom, when these products are sold, and how customers buy these products.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ability to perform trend analysis is important to Global Computing.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div id="OLAUG9307" class="sect1">
<h2 class="sect1">Designing a Dimensional Model for Global Computing</h2>
<p><a href="#CHDHGDCH">&#34;Business Goals&#34;</a> identifies the business facts that support analysis requirements at Global Computing. Next, we identify the dimensions, levels, and attributes in a data model. We also identify the relationships within each dimension. The resulting data model is used to design the Global schema, the dimensional model, and the analytic workspace.</p>
<div id="OLAUG9308" class="sect2"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref700"></a>
<h3 class="sect2">Identifying Dimensions</h3>
<p>Four dimensions are used to organize the facts in the database:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Product shows how data varies by product.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Customer shows how data varies by customer or geographic area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Channel shows how data varies according to each distribution channel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Time shows how data varies over time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<!-- class="sect2" -->
<div id="OLAUG9309" class="sect2"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref701"></a>
<h3 class="sect2">Identifying Levels</h3>
<p>Now that we have identified dimensions, we can identify the levels of summarization within each dimension. Analysis requirements at Global Computing reveal that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There are three distribution channels: Sales, Catalog, and Internet. These three values are the lowest level of detail in the data warehouse and are grouped in the Channel level. From the order of highest level of summarization to the lowest level of detail, the levels are Total and Channel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Global performs customer and geographic analysis along the line of shipments to customers and by market segmentation. Shipments and Market are two hierarchies in the Customer dimension. In each case, the lowest level of detail in the data model is the Ship To location.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When analyzing along the line of customer shipments, the levels of summarization are (highest to lowest): Total, Region, Warehouse, and Ship To.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When analyzing by market segmentation, the levels of summarization are (highest to lowest): Total, Market Segment, Account, and Ship To.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Product dimension has four levels (highest to lowest): Total, Class, Family, and Item.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Time dimension has four levels (highest to lowest): Total, Year, Quarter, and Month. The dimension has two hierarchies: Calendar and Fiscal.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All dimensions have a Total level as the highest level of summarization. Adding this highest level provides additional flexibility as application users analyze data.</p>
</div>
<!-- class="sect2" -->
<div id="OLAUG9310" class="sect2"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref702"></a>
<h3 class="sect2">Identifying Hierarchies</h3>
<p>We can identify the hierarchies that organize the levels within each dimension. To identify hierarchies, we group the levels in the correct order of summarization and in a way that supports the identified types of analysis.</p>
<p>For the Channel and Product dimensions, Global Computing requires only one hierarchy for each dimension. For the Customer dimension, Global Computing requires two hierarchies. Analysis within the Customer dimension tends to be either by geographic area or market segment. Therefore, we organize levels into two hierarchies, Shipments and Segment. Analysis over time also requires two hierarchies, a Calendar hierarchy and a Fiscal hierarchy.</p>
</div>
<!-- class="sect2" -->
<div id="OLAUG9311" class="sect2"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref703"></a>
<h3 class="sect2">Identifying Stored Measures</h3>
<p><a href="#CHDDEHGB">&#34;Identifying Required Business Facts&#34;</a> lists 21 business facts that are required to support the analysis requirements of Global Computing. Of this number, only four facts must be acquired from the transactional database:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Units</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sales</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unit Price</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unit Cost</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a id="sthref704"></a>All of the other facts can be derived from these basic facts. The derived facts can be calculated in the analytic workspace on demand. If experience shows that some of these derived facts are being used heavily and the calculations are putting a noticeable load on the system, then some of these facts can be calculated and stored in the analytic workspace as a data maintenance procedure.</p>
