<pre>This graphic shows four levels of a hierarchical tree.
Level 1 contains the root/parent node of the tree.
A root node is always at the top of a hierarchical tree.
The root node has two &#34;children&#34; at Level 2. Each of these
children in turn has children at Level 3. Therefore,
the Level 2 nodes are parent/child nodes. At Level 3, some of
the nodes in turn have children at Level 4. These Level 3
nodes are parent/child nodes. Other Level 3 nodes have no
children at Level 4. These Level 3 nodes are child/leaf nodes.
A leaf node has no children at lower levels.
