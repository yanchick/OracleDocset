<p>The following warning appears at the top of the page:</p>
<p>&#34;A captured workload can contain references to external systems that may only be meaningful in the capture environment. Replaying a workload with unresolved references to external systems may cause unexpected problems in the production environment. You should perform a replay in a COMPLETELY ISOLATED test environment that may include hosts, networks, e-mail servers, storage systems, and other devices. Make sure to resolve all references to external systems in the replay environment, so that replaying a workload cannot harm your production environment.&#34;</p>
<p>The heading &#34;Isolate Test Database: References to External Systems&#34; appears below the warning. Below the heading is the text &#34;References to external systems may cause problems during the replay.&#34;</p>
<p>The following text precedes a bulleted list with three items: &#34;Use the links below to verify potential references to external systems and modify those that are invalid.&#34;</p>
<p>The links are Database Links, Directory Objects, and Streams. The text for each of these links reads &#34;This link takes you outside of the Database Replay process.&#34;</p>
<p>A tip follows the list that reads &#34;There may be more references to external systems than those found via the above links.&#34;</p>
