<p>This graphic is depicts a Western Region and Eastern Region. The Western Region is a vertical rectangle on the left. Inside are cylinders DB4 and DB1(Oracle RAC). DB1 points to DB4 and is labeled &#34;Data Guard.&#34; DB1 has a double-headed arrow pointing to the global service manager (GSM). DB4 has a double-headed arrow pointing to GSM. GSM has a double headed arrow pointing to a person icon labeled &#34;GDSCTL.&#34; GSM has a double-headed arrow pointing to cylinder CAT Catalog.</p>
<p>The Eastern Region is a vertical rectangle on the right. DB1 in the Western has a double-headed arrow labeled &#34;GoldenGate&#34; pointing to DB2 (Oracle RAC) in the Eastern. DB2 (Eastern) points to three small cylinders on its right labeled &#34;Active Data Guard.&#34; DB2 has a double-headed arrow pointing down to a GSM box. A double-headed arrow is between GSM and one of the Active Data Guard cylinders. The Western and Eastern GSM boxes have a double-headed arrow between them. Below the GSM box is a CAT cylinder. The Western CAT points to the Eastern CAT and is labeled &#34;Data Guard.&#34; Below the Eastern CAT cylinder is a DB5 (Oracle RAC) cylinder. GSM has a double-headed arrow between GSM and DB5. DB5 points toward DB7 and is labeled &#34;Data Guard.&#34; DB4 in the Western and DB5 in the Eastern are connected by a double-headed arrow labeled &#34;GoldenGate.&#34; DB5 points toward DB7 and is labeled &#34;Data Guard.&#34; DB4 and DB5 are in a box labeled HR Pool. At the top of the diagram, DB4 and DB1 (Western) and DB2 and Active Data Guard databases (Eastern) are in a box labeled &#34;Sales Pool.&#34;</p>
