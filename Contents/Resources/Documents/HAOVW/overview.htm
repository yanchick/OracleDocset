<h2 class="sect1"><span class="secnum">1.1</span> What Is High Availability<a id="sthref7"></a>?</h2>
<p><a id="sthref8"></a><span class="bold">Availability</span> is the degree to which an application, service, or function is accessible on demand. Availability is measured by the perception of an application&#39;s user. Users experience frustration when their data is unavailable or the computing system is not performing as expected, and they do not understand or care to differentiate between the complex components of an overall solution. Performance failures due to higher than expected usage create the same disruption as the failure of critical components in the <a id="sthref9"></a>architecture. If a user cannot access the system, it is said to be <span class="bold">unavailable</span>. Generally, the term <span class="bold">downtime</span> is used to refer to periods when a system is unavailable.</p>
<p>Users who want their systems to be always ready to serve them need <span class="bold"><a id="sthref10"></a>high availability</span>. A system that is highly available is designed to provide uninterrupted computing services during essential time periods, during most hours of the day, and most days of the week throughout the year; this measurement is often shown as <a id="sthref11"></a><a id="sthref12"></a><span class="bold">24x365</span>. Such systems may also need a high availability solution for planned maintenance operations such as upgrading a system&#39;s hardware or software.</p>
<p><a id="sthref13"></a>Reliability, recoverability, timely error detection, and continuous operations are primary characteristics of a highly available solution:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Reliability</span>: Reliable hardware is one component of a high availability solution. Reliable software&mdash;including the database, web servers, and applications&mdash;is just as critical to implementing a highly available solution. A related characteristic is resilience. For example, low-cost commodity hardware, combined with software such as Oracle Real Application Clusters (Oracle RAC), can be used to implement a very reliable system. The <span class="italic">resilience</span> of an Oracle RAC database allows processing to continue even though individual servers may fail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Recoverability</span>: There may be many ways to recover from a failure. Therefore, it is important to determine what types of failures may occur in your high availability environment and how to recover from those failures quickly in order to meet your business requirements. For example, if a critical table is accidentally deleted from the database, what action should you take to recover it? Does your <a id="sthref14"></a>architecture provide the ability to recover in the time specified in a service-level agreement (SLA)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Timely error detection</span>: If a component in your architecture fails, then fast detection is essential to recover from the unexpected failure. Although you may be able to recover quickly from an outage, if it takes an additional 90 minutes to discover the problem, then you may not meet your SLA. Monitoring the health of your environment requires reliable software to view it quickly and the ability to notify the database administrator of a problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Continuous operation</span>: Providing continuous access to your data is essential when very little or no downtime is acceptable to perform maintenance activities. Activities, such as moving a table to another location in the database or even adding CPUs to your hardware, should be transparent to the user in a high availability architecture.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>More specifically, a high availability architecture should have the<a id="sthref15"></a> following traits:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tolerate failures such that processing continues with minimal or no interruption</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be transparent to&mdash;or tolerant of&mdash;system, data, or application changes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide built-in preventive measures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide active monitoring and fast detection of failures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide fast recoverability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automate detection and recovery operations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Protect the data to minimize or prevent data loss</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implement the operational best practices to manage your environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Achieve the goals set in SLAs (for example, recovery time objectives (RTOs) and recovery point objectives (RPOs)) for the lowest possible total cost of ownership</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div id="HAOVW112" class="sect1">
<h2 class="sect1"><span class="secnum">1.2</span> Importance of Availability</h2>
<p>The <a id="sthref16"></a>importance of high availability varies among applications. Databases and the Internet have enabled worldwide collaboration and information sharing by extending the reach of database applications throughout organizations and communities. This reach emphasizes the importance of high availability in data management solutions. Both small businesses and global enterprises have users all over the world who require access to data 24 hours a day. Without this data access, operations can stop, and revenue is lost. Users now demand service-level agreements from their information technology (IT) departments and solution providers, reflecting the increasing dependence on these solutions. Increasingly, availability is measured in dollars, euros, and yen, not just in time and convenience.</p>
<p>Enterprises have used their IT infrastructure to provide a competitive advantage, increase productivity, and empower users to make faster and more informed decisions. However, with these benefits has come an increasing dependence on that infrastructure. If a critical application becomes unavailable, then the business can be in jeopardy. The business might lose revenue, incur penalties, and receive bad publicity that has a lasting effect on customers and on the company&#39;s stock price.</p>
<p>It is important to examine the <a id="sthref17"></a><a id="sthref18"></a>factors that determine how your data is protected and maximize availability to your users.</p>

<h2 class="sect1"><span class="secnum">1.3</span> Cost of Downtime<a id="sthref19"></a></h2>
<p>The need to deliver increasing levels of availability continues to accelerate as enterprises reengineer their solutions to gain competitive advantage. Most often, these new solutions rely on immediate access to critical business data. When data is not available, the operation can cease to function. Downtime can lead to lost productivity, lost revenue, damaged customer relationships, bad publicity, and lawsuits.</p>
<p>It is not always easy to place a direct cost on downtime. Angry customers, idle employees, and bad publicity are all costly, but not directly measured in currency. On the other hand, lost revenue and legal penalties incurred because SLA objectives are not met can easily be quantified. The cost of downtime can quickly grow in industries that are dependent on their solutions to provide service.</p>
<p>Other <a id="sthref20"></a><a id="sthref21"></a>factors to consider in the cost of downtime are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The maximum tolerable length of a single unplanned outage</p>
<p>If the event lasts less than 30 seconds, then it may cause very little impact and may be barely perceptible to users. As the length of the outage grows, the effect may grow exponentially and negatively affect the business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The maximum frequency of allowable incidents</p>
<p>Frequent outages, even if short in duration, may similarly disrupt business operations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When designing a solution, it is important to recognize the true cost of downtime to understand how the business can benefit from availability improvements.</p>
<p>Oracle provides a range of high availability solutions to fit every organization regardless of size. Small workgroups and global enterprises alike are able to extend the reach of their critical business applications. With Oracle and the Internet, applications and data are reliably accessible everywhere, at any time.</p>

<h2 class="sect1"><span class="secnum">1.4</span> Causes of Downtime<a id="sthref22"></a></h2>
<p>One of the challenges in designing a high availability solution is examining and addressing all of the possible causes of downtime. It is important to consider causes of both unplanned and planned downtime when designing a fault-tolerant and resilient IT infrastructure. Planned downtime can be just as disruptive to operations as unplanned downtime, especially in global enterprises that support users in multiple time zones.</p>

<p>A corrupt block is a block that was changed so that it differs from what Oracle Database expects to find. Block corruptions can be categorized as physical or logical:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In a <a id="sthref33"></a><a id="sthref34"></a><span class="bold"><a href="glossary.htm#CBAEHHIG"><span class="xrefglossterm">physical block corruption</span></a></span>, which is also called a media corruption, the database does not recognize the block at all: the checksum is invalid or the block contains all zeros. An example of a more sophisticated block corruption is when the block header and footer do not match.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a <a id="sthref35"></a><span class="bold"><a href="glossary.htm#CBAJAEHF"><span class="xrefglossterm">logical block corruption</span></a></span>, the contents of the block are physically sound and pass the physical block checks; however, the block can be logically inconsistent. Examples of logical block corruption include incorrect block type, incorrect data or redo block sequence number, corruption of a row piece or index entry, or data dictionary corruptions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Block corruptions can also be divided into interblock corruption and intrablock corruption:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In <span class="bold"><a id="sthref36"></a>intrablock corruption</span>, the corruption occurs in the block itself and can be either a physical or a logical block corruption.</p>

<li>
<p>In an <a id="sthref37"></a><span class="bold">interblock corruption</span>, the corruption occurs between blocks and can only be a logical block corruption.</p>

<p>A data corruption outage occurs when a hardware, software, or network component causes corrupt data to be read or written.

<td class="cellalignment4492" headers="r9c1-t2 r1c2-t2">
<p>A lost or stray write is another form of data corruption, but it is much more difficult to detect and repair quickly. A data block stray or lost write occurs when:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For a <span class="bold">lost write</span>, an I/O subsystem acknowledges the completion of the block write even though the write I/O did not occur in the persistent storage. On a subsequent block read on the primary database, the I/O subsystem returns the stale version of the data block, which might be used to update other blocks of the database, thereby corrupting it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For a <span class="bold">stray write</span>, the write I/O completed but it was written somewhere else, and a subsequent read operation returns the stale value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For an Oracle RAC system, a read I/O from one cluster node returns stale data after a write I/O is completed from another node (lost write). For example, this occurs if a network file system (NFS) is mounted in Oracle RAC without disabling attribute caching (for example, without using the <code>noac</code> option). In this case, the write I/O from one node is not immediately visible to another node because it is cached.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Block corruptions caused by stray writes or lost writes can cause havoc to your database availability. The data block may be physically or logically correct but subsequent disk reads will show blocks that are stale or with an incorrect Oracle Database block address.</p>

<p>Oracle high availability solutions and sound operational practices are key to the successful implementation of an IT infrastructure. However, technology alone is not enough.</p>
<p>Choosing and implementing an architecture that best fits your availability requirements can be a daunting task. Maximum Availability Architecture (MAA) simplifies the process of choosing and implementing a high availability architecture to fit your business requirements. The MAA:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Encompasses redundancy across all components</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provides protection and tolerance from computer failures, storage failures, human errors, data corruption, lost writes, system delays or slowdowns, and site disasters</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recovers from outages as quickly and transparently as possible</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provides solutions to eliminate or reduce planned downtime</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provides consistent high performance and robust security</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provides Oracle Engineered System options to simplify deployment, management, scalability, and availability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Achieves SLAs at the lowest possible total cost of ownership</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To build, implement, and maintain this type of <a id="sthref45"></a><a id="sthref46"></a>architecture, you need to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Analyze your specific high availability requirements, including both the technical and operational aspects of your IT systems and business processes, as described in <a href="hadesign.htm#g1007388">Chapter 2, &#34;High Availability and Data Protection &ndash; Getting From Requirements to Architecture.&#34;</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Familiarize yourself with Oracle high availability features, as described in <a href="hafeatures.htm#CIHFBHGH">Chapter 3, &#34;Features for Maximizing Availability.&#34;</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understand the availability impact for each MAA tier or various high availability features on businesses and applications, as described in <a href="unplanned.htm#BABHDCGI">Chapter 4, &#34;Oracle Database High Availability Solutions for Unplanned Downtime,&#34;</a> and <a href="planned.htm#CIHDCJCE">Chapter 5, &#34;Oracle Database High Availability Solutions for Planned Downtime.&#34;</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use operational best practices to provide a successful MAA implementation, as described in <a href="operational_bps.htm#CHDJHADI">Chapter 6, &#34;Operational Prerequisites to Maximizing Availability.&#34;</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose a high availability architecture, as described in <a href="architectures.htm#CJAIJFHC">Chapter 7, &#34;High Availability Architectures.&#34;</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn how Oracle&#39;s Engineered Systems such Oracle Exadata Database Machine, Oracle SuperCluster, or Oracle Database Appliance can contribute to your overall MAA, as described in <a href="haexadata.htm#CHDGFJFH">Chapter 8, &#34;Oracle Engineered Systems.&#34;</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optimize your return on investment (ROI) of any of the high availability architectures and solutions, with Oracle Grid Computing, Oracle Active Data Guard real time reporting and utilization, Oracle Database multitenant architecture using pluggable databases, or Oracle Virtualization and Oracle Data Cloud, as described in <a href="grid.htm#BABCAGGF">Chapter 9, &#34;Optimizing Return on Investment.&#34;</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implement a high availability architecture using the following resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>MAA and high availability best practices white papers and other information</p>
<p>Oracle offers various best practices white papers, customer MAA papers with proof of concepts, customer case studies, recorded web casts, demonstrations, and presentations. These resources provide technical details about the MAA various high availability technologies, along with best practice recommendations for configuring and using such technologies.</p>
<p>These MAA resources are available at <code><a href="http://www.oracle.com/goto/maa/">http://www.oracle.com/goto/maa</a></code></p>
